<h1>Class#class_attribute</h1>


<p>Declare a class-level attribute whose value is inheritable by subclasses.
Subclasses can change their own value and it will not impact parent class.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">class Base
  class_attribute :setting
end

class Subclass &lt; Base
end

Base.setting = true
Subclass.setting            # =&gt; true
Subclass.setting = false
Subclass.setting            # =&gt; false
Base.setting                # =&gt; true</pre>

<p>In the above case as long as Subclass does not assign a value to setting by
performing <tt>Subclass.setting = <em>something</em> </tt>,
<tt>Subclass.setting</tt> would read value assigned to parent class. Once
Subclass assigns a value then the value assigned by Subclass would be
returned.</p>

<p>This matches normal Ruby method inheritance: think of writing an attribute
on a subclass as overriding the reader method. However, you need to be
aware when using <tt>class_attribute</tt> with mutable structures as
<tt>Array</tt> or <tt>Hash</tt>. In such cases, you don't want to do
changes in places but use setters:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">Base.setting = []
Base.setting                # =&gt; []
Subclass.setting            # =&gt; []

# Appending in child changes both parent and child because it is the same object:
Subclass.setting &lt;&lt; :foo
Base.setting               # =&gt; [:foo]
Subclass.setting           # =&gt; [:foo]

# Use setters to not propagate changes:
Base.setting = []
Subclass.setting += [:foo]
Base.setting               # =&gt; []
Subclass.setting           # =&gt; [:foo]</pre>

<p>For convenience, a query method is defined as well:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">Subclass.setting?       # =&gt; false</pre>

<p>Instances may overwrite the class value in the same way:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">Base.setting = true
object = Base.new
object.setting          # =&gt; true
object.setting = false
object.setting          # =&gt; false
Base.setting            # =&gt; true</pre>

<p>To opt out of the instance reader method, pass :instance_reader =&gt;
false.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">object.setting          # =&gt; NoMethodError
object.setting?         # =&gt; NoMethodError</pre>

<p>To opt out of the instance writer method, pass :instance_writer =&gt;
false.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">object.setting = false  # =&gt; NoMethodError</pre>
