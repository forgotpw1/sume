Extends the API for constants to be able to deal with qualified names. Arguments
are assumed to be relative to the receiver.

--
Qualified names are required to be relative because we are extending existing
methods that expect constant names, ie, relative paths of length 1. For example,
Object.const_get('::String') raises NameError and so does qualified_const_get.
