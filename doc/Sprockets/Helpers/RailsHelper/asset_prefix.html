<h1>Sprockets::Helpers::RailsHelper#asset_prefix</h1>


<p>Override to specify an alternative prefix for asset path generation. When
combined with a custom <tt>asset_environment</tt>, this can be used to
implement themes that can take advantage of the asset pipeline.</p>

<p>If you only want to change where the assets are mounted, refer to
<tt>config.assets.prefix</tt> instead.</p>
