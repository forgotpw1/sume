<h1>ActionView::Template::Handlers#register_template_handler</h1>


<p>Register a class that knows how to handle template files with the given
extension. This can be used to implement new template types. The
constructor for the class must take the ActiveView::Base instance as a
parameter, and the class must implement a <tt>render</tt> method that takes
the contents of the template to render as well as the Hash of local assigns
available to the template. The <tt>render</tt> method ought to return the
rendered template as a string.</p>
