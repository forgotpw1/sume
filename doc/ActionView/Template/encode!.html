<h1>ActionView::Template#encode!</h1>

This method is responsible for properly setting the encoding of the
source. Until this point, we assume that the source is BINARY data.
If no additional information is supplied, we assume the encoding is
the same as <tt>Encoding.default_external</tt>.

The user can also specify the encoding via a comment on the first
line of the template (# encoding: NAME-OF-ENCODING). This will work
with any template engine, as we process out the encoding comment
before passing the source on to the template engine, leaving a
blank line in its stead.
