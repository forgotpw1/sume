<h1>ActionView::Template#refresh</h1>


<p>Receives a view object and return a template similar to self by using
@virtual_path.</p>

<p>This method is useful if you have a template object but it does not contain
its source anymore since it was already compiled. In such cases, all you
need to do is to call refresh passing in the view object.</p>

<p>Notice this method raises an error if the template to be refreshed does not
have a virtual path set (true just for inline templates).</p>
