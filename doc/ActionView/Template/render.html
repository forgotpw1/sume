<h1>ActionView::Template#render</h1>

Render a template. If the template was not compiled yet, it is done
exactly before rendering.

This method is instrumented as "!render_template.action_view". Notice that
we use a bang in this instrumentation because you don't want to
consume this in production. This is only slow if it's being listened to.
