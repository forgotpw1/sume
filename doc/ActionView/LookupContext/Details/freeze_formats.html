<h1>ActionView::LookupContext::Details#freeze_formats</h1>


<p>Freeze the current formats in the lookup context. By freezing them, you are
guaranteeing that next template lookups are not going to modify the
formats. The controller can also use this, to ensure that formats won't be
further modified (as it does in respond_to blocks).</p>
