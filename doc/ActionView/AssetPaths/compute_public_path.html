<p>Add the extension <tt>ext</tt> if not present. Return full or
scheme-relative URLs otherwise untouched. Prefix with <tt>/dir/</tt> if
lacking a leading <tt>/</tt>. Account for relative URL roots. Rewrite the
asset path for cache-busting asset ids. Include asset host, if configured,
with the correct request protocol.</p>

<p>When :relative (default), the protocol will be determined by the client
using current protocol When :request, the protocol will be the request
protocol Otherwise, the protocol is used (E.g. :http, :https, etc)</p>
