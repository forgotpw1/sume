= Action View Lookup Context

LookupContext is the object responsible to hold all information required to lookup
templates, i.e. view paths and details. The LookupContext is also responsible to
generate a key, given to view paths, used in the resolver cache lookup. Since
this key is generated just once during the request, it speeds up all cache accesses.
