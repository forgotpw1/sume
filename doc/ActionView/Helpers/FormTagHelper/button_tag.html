<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormTagHelper#button_tag</h1>

Creates a button element that defines a <tt>submit</tt> button,
<tt>reset</tt>button or a generic button which can be used in
JavaScript, for example. You can use the button tag as a regular
submit tag but it isn't supported in legacy browsers. However,
the button tag allows richer labels such as images and emphasis,
so this helper will also accept a block.

==== Options
* <tt>:confirm => 'question?'</tt> - If present, the
  unobtrusive JavaScript drivers will provide a prompt with
  the question specified. If the user accepts, the form is
  processed normally, otherwise no action is taken.
* <tt>:disabled</tt> - If true, the user will not be able to
  use this input.
* Any other key creates standard HTML options for the tag.

==== Examples
  button_tag
  # => <button name="button" type="submit">Button</button>

  button_tag(:type => 'button') do
    content_tag(:strong, 'Ask me!')
  end
  # => <button name="button" type="button">
  #     <strong>Ask me!</strong>
  #    </button>
