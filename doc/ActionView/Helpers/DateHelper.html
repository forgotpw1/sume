= Action View Date Helpers

The Date Helper primarily creates select/option tags for different kinds of dates and times or date and time
elements. All of the select-type methods share a number of common options that are as follows:

* <tt>:prefix</tt> - overwrites the default prefix of "date" used for the select names. So specifying "birthday"
would give \birthday[month] instead of \date[month] if passed to the <tt>select_month</tt> method.
* <tt>:include_blank</tt> - set to true if it should be possible to set an empty date.
* <tt>:discard_type</tt> - set to true if you want to discard the type part of the select name. If set to true,
  the <tt>select_month</tt> method would use simply "date" (which can be overwritten using <tt>:prefix</tt>) instead
  of \date[month].
