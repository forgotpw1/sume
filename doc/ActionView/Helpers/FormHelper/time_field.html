<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper#time_field</h1>

Returns a text_field of type "time".

The default value is generated by trying to call +strftime+ with "%T.%L"
on the objects's value. It is still possible to override that
by passing the "value" option.

=== Options
* Accepts same options as time_field_tag

=== Example
  time_field("task", "started_at")
  # => <input id="task_started_at" name="task[started_at]" type="time" />
