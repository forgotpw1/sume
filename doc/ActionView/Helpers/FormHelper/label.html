<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper#label</h1>

Returns a label tag tailored for labelling an input field for a specified attribute (identified by +method+) on an object
assigned to the template (identified by +object+). The text of label will default to the attribute name unless a translation
is found in the current I18n locale (through helpers.label.<modelname>.<attribute>) or you specify it explicitly.
Additional options on the label tag can be passed as a hash with +options+. These options will be tagged
onto the HTML as an HTML element attribute as in the example shown, except for the <tt>:value</tt> option, which is designed to
target labels for radio_button tags (where the value is used in the ID of the input tag).

==== Examples
  label(:post, :title)
  # => <label for="post_title">Title</label>

  You can localize your labels based on model and attribute names.
  For example you can define the following in your locale (e.g. en.yml)

  helpers:
    label:
      post:
        body: "Write your entire text here"

  Which then will result in

  label(:post, :body)
  # => <label for="post_body">Write your entire text here</label>

Localization can also be based purely on the translation of the attribute-name
(if you are using ActiveRecord):

  activerecord:
    attributes:
      post:
        cost: "Total cost"

  label(:post, :cost)
  # => <label for="post_cost">Total cost</label>

  label(:post, :title, "A short title")
  # => <label for="post_title">A short title</label>

  label(:post, :title, "A short title", :class => "title_label")
  # => <label for="post_title" class="title_label">A short title</label>

  label(:post, :privacy, "Public Post", :value => "public")
  # => <label for="post_privacy_public">Public Post</label>

  label(:post, :terms) do
    'Accept <a href="/terms">Terms</a>.'.html_safe
  end
