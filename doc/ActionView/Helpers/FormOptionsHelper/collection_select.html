<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormOptionsHelper#collection_select</h1>

Returns <tt><select></tt> and <tt><option></tt> tags for the collection of existing return values of
+method+ for +object+'s class. The value returned from calling +method+ on the instance +object+ will
be selected. If calling +method+ returns +nil+, no selection is made without including <tt>:prompt</tt>
or <tt>:include_blank</tt> in the +options+ hash.

The <tt>:value_method</tt> and <tt>:text_method</tt> parameters are methods to be called on each member
of +collection+. The return values are used as the +value+ attribute and contents of each
<tt><option></tt> tag, respectively. They can also be any object that responds to +call+, such
as a +proc+, that will be called for each member of the +collection+ to
retrieve the value/text.

Example object structure for use with this method:
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author
  end
  class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
    def name_with_initial
      "#{first_name.first}. #{last_name}"
    end
  end

Sample usage (selecting the associated Author for an instance of Post, <tt>@post</tt>):
  collection_select(:post, :author_id, Author.all, :id, :name_with_initial, :prompt => true)

If <tt>@post.author_id</tt> is already <tt>1</tt>, this would return:
  <select name="post[author_id]">
    <option value="">Please select</option>
    <option value="1" selected="selected">D. Heinemeier Hansson</option>
    <option value="2">D. Thomas</option>
    <option value="3">M. Clark</option>
  </select>
