<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormOptionsHelper#option_groups_from_collection_for_select</h1>

Returns a string of <tt><option></tt> tags, like <tt>options_from_collection_for_select</tt>, but
groups them by <tt><optgroup></tt> tags based on the object relationships of the arguments.

Parameters:
* +collection+ - An array of objects representing the <tt><optgroup></tt> tags.
* +group_method+ - The name of a method which, when called on a member of +collection+, returns an
  array of child objects representing the <tt><option></tt> tags.
* group_label_method+ - The name of a method which, when called on a member of +collection+, returns a
  string to be used as the +label+ attribute for its <tt><optgroup></tt> tag.
* +option_key_method+ - The name of a method which, when called on a child object of a member of
  +collection+, returns a value to be used as the +value+ attribute for its <tt><option></tt> tag.
* +option_value_method+ - The name of a method which, when called on a child object of a member of
  +collection+, returns a value to be used as the contents of its <tt><option></tt> tag.
* +selected_key+ - A value equal to the +value+ attribute for one of the <tt><option></tt> tags,
  which will have the +selected+ attribute set. Corresponds to the return value of one of the calls
  to +option_key_method+. If +nil+, no selection is made. Can also be a hash if disabled values are
  to be specified.

Example object structure for use with this method:
  class Continent < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :countries
    # attribs: id, name
  end
  class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :continent
    # attribs: id, name, continent_id
  end

Sample usage:
  option_groups_from_collection_for_select(@continents, :countries, :name, :id, :name, 3)

Possible output:
  <optgroup label="Africa">
    <option value="1">Egypt</option>
    <option value="4">Rwanda</option>
    ...
  </optgroup>
  <optgroup label="Asia">
    <option value="3" selected="selected">China</option>
    <option value="12">India</option>
    <option value="5">Japan</option>
    ...
  </optgroup>

<b>Note:</b> Only the <tt><optgroup></tt> and <tt><option></tt> tags are returned, so you still have to
wrap the output in an appropriate <tt><select></tt> tag.
