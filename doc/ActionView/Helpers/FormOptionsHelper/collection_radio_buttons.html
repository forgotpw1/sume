<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormOptionsHelper#collection_radio_buttons</h1>

Returns radio button tags for the collection of existing return values
of +method+ for +object+'s class. The value returned from calling
+method+ on the instance +object+ will be selected. If calling +method+
returns +nil+, no selection is made.

The <tt>:value_method</tt> and <tt>:text_method</tt> parameters are
methods to be called on each member of +collection+. The return values
are used as the +value+ attribute and contents of each radio button tag,
respectively. They can also be any object that responds to +call+, such
as a +proc+, that will be called for each member of the +collection+ to
retrieve the value/text.

Example object structure for use with this method:
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author
  end
  class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
    def name_with_initial
      "#{first_name.first}. #{last_name}"
    end
  end

Sample usage (selecting the associated Author for an instance of Post, <tt>@post</tt>):
  collection_radio_buttons(:post, :author_id, Author.all, :id, :name_with_initial)

If <tt>@post.author_id</tt> is already <tt>1</tt>, this would return:
  <input id="post_author_id_1" name="post[author_id]" type="radio" value="1" checked="checked" />
  <label for="post_author_id_1">D. Heinemeier Hansson</label>
  <input id="post_author_id_2" name="post[author_id]" type="radio" value="2" />
  <label for="post_author_id_2">D. Thomas</label>
  <input id="post_author_id_3" name="post[author_id]" type="radio" value="3" />
  <label for="post_author_id_3">M. Clark</label>

It is also possible to customize the way the elements will be shown by
giving a block to the method:
  collection_radio_buttons(:post, :author_id, Author.all, :id, :name_with_initial) do |b|
    b.label { b.radio_button }
  end

The argument passed to the block is a special kind of builder for this
collection, which has the ability to generate the label and radio button
for the current item in the collection, with proper text and value.
Using it, you can change the label and radio button display order or
even use the label as wrapper, as in the example above.

The builder methods <tt>label</tt> and <tt>radio_button</tt> also accept
extra html options:
  collection_radio_buttons(:post, :author_id, Author.all, :id, :name_with_initial) do |b|
    b.label(:class => "radio_button") { b.radio_button(:class => "radio_button") }
  end

There are also three special methods available: <tt>object</tt>, <tt>text</tt> and
<tt>value</tt>, which are the current item being rendered, its text and value methods,
respectively. You can use them like this:
  collection_radio_buttons(:post, :author_id, Author.all, :id, :name_with_initial) do |b|
     b.label(:"data-value" => b.value) { b.radio_button + b.text }
  end
