<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormOptionsHelper#options_from_collection_for_select</h1>

Returns a string of option tags that have been compiled by iterating over the +collection+ and assigning
the result of a call to the +value_method+ as the option value and the +text_method+ as the option text.
Example:
  options_from_collection_for_select(@people, 'id', 'name')
This will output the same HTML as if you did this:
  <option value="#{person.id}">#{person.name}</option>

This is more often than not used inside a #select_tag like this example:
  select_tag 'person', options_from_collection_for_select(@people, 'id', 'name')

If +selected+ is specified as a value or array of values, the element(s) returning a match on +value_method+
will be selected option tag(s).

If +selected+ is specified as a Proc, those members of the collection that return true for the anonymous
function are the selected values.

+selected+ can also be a hash, specifying both <tt>:selected</tt> and/or <tt>:disabled</tt> values as required.

Be sure to specify the same class as the +value_method+ when specifying selected or disabled options.
Failure to do this will produce undesired results. Example:
  options_from_collection_for_select(@people, 'id', 'name', '1')
Will not select a person with the id of 1 because 1 (an Integer) is not the same as '1' (a string)
  options_from_collection_for_select(@people, 'id', 'name', 1)
should produce the desired results.
