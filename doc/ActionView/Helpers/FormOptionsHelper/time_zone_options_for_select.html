<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormOptionsHelper#time_zone_options_for_select</h1>

Returns a string of option tags for pretty much any time zone in the
world. Supply a ActiveSupport::TimeZone name as +selected+ to have it
marked as the selected option tag. You can also supply an array of
ActiveSupport::TimeZone objects as +priority_zones+, so that they will
be listed above the rest of the (long) list. (You can use
ActiveSupport::TimeZone.us_zones as a convenience for obtaining a list
of the US time zones, or a Regexp to select the zones of your choice)

The +selected+ parameter must be either +nil+, or a string that names
a ActiveSupport::TimeZone.

By default, +model+ is the ActiveSupport::TimeZone constant (which can
be obtained in Active Record as a value object). The only requirement
is that the +model+ parameter be an object that responds to +all+, and
returns an array of objects that represent time zones.

NOTE: Only the option tags are returned, you have to wrap this call in
a regular HTML select tag.
