<h1>ActionView::Helpers::FormOptionsHelper#time_zone_options_for_select</h1>


<p>Returns a string of option tags for pretty much any time zone in the world.
Supply a ActiveSupport::TimeZone name as <tt>selected</tt> to have it
marked as the selected option tag. You can also supply an array of
ActiveSupport::TimeZone objects as <tt>priority_zones</tt>, so that they
will be listed above the rest of the (long) list. (You can use
ActiveSupport::TimeZone.us_zones as a convenience for obtaining a list of
the US time zones, or a Regexp to select the zones of your choice)</p>

<p>The <tt>selected</tt> parameter must be either <tt>nil</tt>, or a string
that names a ActiveSupport::TimeZone.</p>

<p>By default, <tt>model</tt> is the ActiveSupport::TimeZone constant (which
can be obtained in Active Record as a value object). The only requirement
is that the <tt>model</tt> parameter be an object that responds to
<tt>all</tt>, and returns an array of objects that represent time zones.</p>

<p>NOTE: Only the option tags are returned, you have to wrap this call in a
regular HTML select tag.</p>
