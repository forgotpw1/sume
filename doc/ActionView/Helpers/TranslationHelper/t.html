<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TranslationHelper#t</h1>


<p>Delegates to <tt>I18n#translate</tt> but also performs three additional
functions.</p>

<p>First, it'll pass the <tt>:rescue_format =&gt; :html</tt> option to I18n so
that any thrown <tt>MissingTranslation</tt> messages will be turned into
inline spans that</p>

<pre>* have a &quot;translation-missing&quot; class set,
* contain the missing key as a title attribute and
* a titleized version of the last key segment as a text.</pre>

<p>E.g. the value returned for a missing translation key :"blog.post.title"
will be &lt;span class="translation_missing" title="translation missing:
en.blog.post.title"&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;. This way your views will display
rather reasonable strings but it will still be easy to spot missing
translations.</p>

<p>Second, it'll scope the key by the current partial if the key starts with a
period. So if you call <tt>translate(&quot;.foo&quot;)</tt> from the
<tt>people/index.html.erb</tt> template, you'll actually be calling
<tt>I18n.translate(&quot;people.index.foo&quot;)</tt>. This makes it less
repetitive to translate many keys within the same partials and gives you a
simple framework for scoping them consistently. If you don't prepend the
key with a period, nothing is converted.</p>

<p>Third, it'll mark the translation as safe HTML if the key has the suffix
"_html" or the last element of the key is the word "html". For example,
calling translate("footer_html") or translate("footer.html") will return a
safe HTML string that won't be escaped by other HTML helper methods. This
naming convention helps to identify translations that include HTML tags so
that you know what kind of output to expect when you call translate in a
template.</p>
