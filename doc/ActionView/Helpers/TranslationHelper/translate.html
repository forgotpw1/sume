<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TranslationHelper#translate</h1>

Delegates to <tt>I18n#translate</tt> but also performs three additional functions.

First, it'll pass the <tt>:rescue_format => :html</tt> option to I18n so that any
thrown +MissingTranslation+ messages will be turned into inline spans that

  * have a "translation-missing" class set,
  * contain the missing key as a title attribute and
  * a titleized version of the last key segment as a text.

E.g. the value returned for a missing translation key :"blog.post.title" will be
<span class="translation_missing" title="translation missing: en.blog.post.title">Title</span>.
This way your views will display rather reasonable strings but it will still
be easy to spot missing translations.

Second, it'll scope the key by the current partial if the key starts
with a period. So if you call <tt>translate(".foo")</tt> from the
<tt>people/index.html.erb</tt> template, you'll actually be calling
<tt>I18n.translate("people.index.foo")</tt>. This makes it less repetitive
to translate many keys within the same partials and gives you a simple framework
for scoping them consistently. If you don't prepend the key with a period,
nothing is converted.

Third, it'll mark the translation as safe HTML if the key has the suffix
"_html" or the last element of the key is the word "html". For example,
calling translate("footer_html") or translate("footer.html") will return
a safe HTML string that won't be escaped by other HTML helper methods. This
naming convention helps to identify translations that include HTML tags so that
you know what kind of output to expect when you call translate in a template.
