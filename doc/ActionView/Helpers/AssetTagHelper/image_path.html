<h1>ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper#image_path</h1>

Computes the path to an image asset.
Full paths from the document root will be passed through.
Used internally by +image_tag+ to build the image path:

  image_path("edit")                                         # => "/assets/edit"
  image_path("edit.png")                                     # => "/assets/edit.png"
  image_path("icons/edit.png")                               # => "/assets/icons/edit.png"
  image_path("/icons/edit.png")                              # => "/icons/edit.png"
  image_path("http://www.example.com/img/edit.png")          # => "http://www.example.com/img/edit.png"

If you have images as application resources this method may conflict with their named routes.
The alias +path_to_image+ is provided to avoid that. Rails uses the alias internally, and
plugin authors are encouraged to do so.
