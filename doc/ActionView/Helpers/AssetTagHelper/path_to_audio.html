<h1>ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper#path_to_audio</h1>

Computes the path to an audio asset in the public audios directory.
Full paths from the document root will be passed through.
Used internally by +audio_tag+ to build the audio path.

  audio_path("horse")                                            # => /audios/horse
  audio_path("horse.wav")                                        # => /audios/horse.wav
  audio_path("sounds/horse.wav")                                 # => /audios/sounds/horse.wav
  audio_path("/sounds/horse.wav")                                # => /sounds/horse.wav
  audio_path("http://www.example.com/sounds/horse.wav")          # => http://www.example.com/sounds/horse.wav
aliased to avoid conflicts with an audio_path named route
