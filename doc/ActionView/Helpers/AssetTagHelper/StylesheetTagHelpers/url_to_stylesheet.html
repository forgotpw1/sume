<h1>ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper::StylesheetTagHelpers#url_to_stylesheet</h1>

Computes the full URL to a stylesheet asset in the public stylesheets directory.
This will use +stylesheet_path+ internally, so most of their behaviors will be the same.
aliased to avoid conflicts with a stylesheet_url named route
