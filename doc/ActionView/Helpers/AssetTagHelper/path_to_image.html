<h1>ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper#path_to_image</h1>


<p>Computes the path to an image asset in the public images directory. Full
paths from the document root will be passed through. Used internally by
<tt>image_tag</tt> to build the image path:</p>

<pre>image_path(&quot;edit&quot;)                                         # =&gt; &quot;/images/edit&quot;
image_path(&quot;edit.png&quot;)                                     # =&gt; &quot;/images/edit.png&quot;
image_path(&quot;icons/edit.png&quot;)                               # =&gt; &quot;/images/icons/edit.png&quot;
image_path(&quot;/icons/edit.png&quot;)                              # =&gt; &quot;/icons/edit.png&quot;
image_path(&quot;http://www.example.com/img/edit.png&quot;)          # =&gt; &quot;http://www.example.com/img/edit.png&quot;</pre>

<p>If you have images as application resources this method may conflict with
their named routes. The alias <tt>path_to_image</tt> is provided to avoid
that. Rails uses the alias internally, and plugin authors are encouraged to
do so. aliased to avoid conflicts with an image_path named route</p>
