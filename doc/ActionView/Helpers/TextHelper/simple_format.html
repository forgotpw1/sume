<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#simple_format</h1>

Returns +text+ transformed into HTML using simple formatting rules.
Two or more consecutive newlines(<tt>\n\n</tt>) are considered as a
paragraph and wrapped in <tt><p></tt> tags. One newline (<tt>\n</tt>) is
considered as a linebreak and a <tt><br /></tt> tag is appended. This
method does not remove the newlines from the +text+.

You can pass any HTML attributes into <tt>html_options</tt>. These
will be added to all created paragraphs.

==== Options
* <tt>:sanitize</tt> - If +false+, does not sanitize +text+.
* <tt>:wrapper_tag</tt> - String representing the wrapper tag, defaults to <tt>"p"</tt>

==== Examples
  my_text = "Here is some basic text...\n...with a line break."

  simple_format(my_text)
  # => "<p>Here is some basic text...\n<br />...with a line break.</p>"

  simple_format(my_text, {}, :wrapper_tag => "div")
  # => "<div>Here is some basic text...\n<br />...with a line break.</div>"

  more_text = "We want to put a paragraph...\n\n...right there."

  simple_format(more_text)
  # => "<p>We want to put a paragraph...</p>\n\n<p>...right there.</p>"

  simple_format("Look ma! A class!", :class => 'description')
  # => "<p class='description'>Look ma! A class!</p>"

  simple_format("<span>I'm allowed!</span> It's true.", {}, :sanitize => false)
  # => "<p><span>I'm allowed!</span> It's true.</p>"
