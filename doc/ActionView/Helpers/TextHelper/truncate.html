<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#truncate</h1>

Truncates a given +text+ after a given <tt>:length</tt> if +text+ is longer than <tt>:length</tt>
(defaults to 30). The last characters will be replaced with the <tt>:omission</tt> (defaults to "...")
for a total length not exceeding <tt>:length</tt>.

Pass a <tt>:separator</tt> to truncate +text+ at a natural break.

The result is not marked as HTML-safe, so will be subject to the default escaping when
used in views, unless wrapped by <tt>raw()</tt>. Care should be taken if +text+ contains HTML tags
or entities, because truncation may produce invalid HTML (such as unbalanced or incomplete tags).
