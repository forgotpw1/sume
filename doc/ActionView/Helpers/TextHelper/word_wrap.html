<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#word_wrap</h1>


<p>Wraps the <tt>text</tt> into lines no longer than <tt>line_width</tt>
width. This method breaks on the first whitespace character that does not
exceed <tt>line_width</tt> (which is 80 by default).</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre data-language="ruby">word_wrap('Once upon a time')
# =&gt; Once upon a time

word_wrap('Once upon a time, in a kingdom called Far Far Away, a king fell ill, and finding a successor to the throne turned out to be more trouble than anyone could have imagined...')
# =&gt; Once upon a time, in a kingdom called Far Far Away, a king fell ill, and finding\n a successor to the throne turned out to be more trouble than anyone could have\n imagined...

word_wrap('Once upon a time', :line_width =&gt; 8)
# =&gt; Once upon\na time

word_wrap('Once upon a time', :line_width =&gt; 1)
# =&gt; Once\nupon\na\ntime</pre>

<p>You can still use <tt>word_wrap</tt> with the old API that accepts the
<tt>line_width</tt> as its optional second parameter:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">word_wrap('Once upon a time', 8)     # =&gt; Once upon\na time</pre>
