<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#excerpt</h1>

Extracts an excerpt from +text+ that matches the first instance of +phrase+.
The <tt>:radius</tt> option expands the excerpt on each side of the first occurrence of +phrase+ by the number of characters
defined in <tt>:radius</tt> (which defaults to 100). If the excerpt radius overflows the beginning or end of the +text+,
then the <tt>:omission</tt> option (which defaults to "...") will be prepended/appended accordingly. The resulting string
will be stripped in any case. If the +phrase+ isn't found, nil is returned.

  excerpt('This is also an example', 'an', :radius => 8, :omission => '<chop> ')
