<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#excerpt</h1>


<p>Extracts an excerpt from <tt>text</tt> that matches the first instance of
<tt>phrase</tt>. The <tt>:radius</tt> option expands the excerpt on each
side of the first occurrence of <tt>phrase</tt> by the number of characters
defined in <tt>:radius</tt> (which defaults to 100). If the excerpt radius
overflows the beginning or end of the <tt>text</tt>, then the
<tt>:omission</tt> option (which defaults to "...") will be
prepended/appended accordingly. The resulting string will be stripped in
any case. If the <tt>phrase</tt> isn't found, nil is returned.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre>excerpt('This is an example', 'an', :radius =&gt; 5)
# =&gt; ...s is an exam...

excerpt('This is an example', 'is', :radius =&gt; 5)
# =&gt; This is a...

excerpt('This is an example', 'is')
# =&gt; This is an example

excerpt('This next thing is an example', 'ex', :radius =&gt; 2)
# =&gt; ...next...

excerpt('This is also an example', 'an', :radius =&gt; 8, :omission =&gt; '&lt;chop&gt; ')
# =&gt; &lt;chop&gt; is also an example</pre>

<p>You can still use <tt>excerpt</tt> with the old API that accepts the
<tt>radius</tt> as its optional third and the <tt>ellipsis</tt> as its
optional forth parameter:</p>

<pre>excerpt('This is an example', 'an', 5)                   # =&gt; ...s is an exam...
excerpt('This is also an example', 'an', 8, '&lt;chop&gt; ')   # =&gt; &lt;chop&gt; is also an example</pre>
