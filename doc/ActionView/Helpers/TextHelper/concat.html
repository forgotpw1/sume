<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#concat</h1>

The preferred method of outputting text in your views is to use the
<%= "text" %> eRuby syntax. The regular _puts_ and _print_ methods
do not operate as expected in an eRuby code block. If you absolutely must
output text within a non-output code block (i.e., <% %>), you can use the concat method.

  <%
      concat "hello"
      # is the equivalent of <%= "hello" %>

      if logged_in
        concat "Logged in!"
      else
        concat link_to('login', :action => :login)
      end
      # will either display "Logged in!" or a login link
  %>
