<h1>ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#highlight</h1>

Highlights one or more +phrases+ everywhere in +text+ by inserting it into
a <tt>:highlighter</tt> string. The highlighter can be specialized by passing <tt>:highlighter</tt>
as a single-quoted string with <tt>\1</tt> where the phrase is to be inserted (defaults to
'<mark>\1</mark>')

  highlight('You searched for: rails', 'rails')
  # => You searched for: <mark>rails</mark>

  highlight('You searched for: ruby, rails, dhh', 'actionpack')
  # => You searched for: ruby, rails, dhh

  highlight('You searched for: rails', ['for', 'rails'], :highlighter => '<em>\1</em>')
  # => You searched <em>for</em>: <em>rails</em>

  highlight('You searched for: rails', 'rails', :highlighter => '<a href="search?q=\1">\1</a>')
  # => You searched for: <a href="search?q=rails">rails</a>
