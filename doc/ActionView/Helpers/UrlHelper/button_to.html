<h1>ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper#button_to</h1>

Generates a form containing a single button that submits to the URL created
by the set of +options+. This is the safest method to ensure links that
cause changes to your data are not triggered by search bots or accelerators.
If the HTML button does not work with your layout, you can also consider
using the +link_to+ method with the <tt>:method</tt> modifier as described in
the +link_to+ documentation.

By default, the generated form element has a class name of <tt>button_to</tt>
to allow styling of the form itself and its children. This can be changed
using the <tt>:form_class</tt> modifier within +html_options+. You can control
the form submission and input element behavior using +html_options+.
This method accepts the <tt>:method</tt> and <tt>:confirm</tt> modifiers
described in the +link_to+ documentation. If no <tt>:method</tt> modifier
is given, it will default to performing a POST operation. You can also
disable the button by passing <tt>:disabled => true</tt> in +html_options+.
If you are using RESTful routes, you can pass the <tt>:method</tt>
to change the HTTP verb used to submit the form.

==== Options
The +options+ hash accepts the same options as +url_for+.

There are a few special +html_options+:
* <tt>:method</tt> - Symbol of HTTP verb. Supported verbs are <tt>:post</tt>, <tt>:get</tt>,
  <tt>:delete</tt>, <tt>:patch</tt>, and <tt>:put</tt>. By default it will be <tt>:post</tt>.
* <tt>:disabled</tt> - If set to true, it will generate a disabled button.
* <tt>:confirm</tt> - This will use the unobtrusive JavaScript driver to
  prompt with the question specified. If the user accepts, the link is
  processed normally, otherwise no action is taken.
* <tt>:remote</tt> -  If set to true, will allow the Unobtrusive JavaScript drivers to control the
  submit behavior. By default this behavior is an ajax submit.
* <tt>:form</tt> - This hash will be form attributes
* <tt>:form_class</tt> - This controls the class of the form within which the submit button will
  be placed
