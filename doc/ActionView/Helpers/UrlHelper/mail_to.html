<h1>ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper#mail_to</h1>

Creates a mailto link tag to the specified +email_address+, which is
also used as the name of the link unless +name+ is specified. Additional
HTML attributes for the link can be passed in +html_options+.

+mail_to+ has several methods for hindering email harvesters and customizing
the email itself by passing special keys to +html_options+.

==== Options
* <tt>:encode</tt> - This key will accept the strings "javascript" or "hex".
  Passing "javascript" will dynamically create and encode the mailto link then
  eval it into the DOM of the page. This method will not show the link on
  the page if the user has JavaScript disabled. Passing "hex" will hex
  encode the +email_address+ before outputting the mailto link.
* <tt>:replace_at</tt> - When the link +name+ isn't provided, the
  +email_address+ is used for the link label. You can use this option to
  obfuscate the +email_address+ by substituting the @ sign with the string
  given as the value.
* <tt>:replace_dot</tt> - When the link +name+ isn't provided, the
  +email_address+ is used for the link label. You can use this option to
  obfuscate the +email_address+ by substituting the . in the email with the
  string given as the value.
* <tt>:subject</tt> - Preset the subject line of the email.
* <tt>:body</tt> - Preset the body of the email.
* <tt>:cc</tt> - Carbon Copy additional recipients on the email.
* <tt>:bcc</tt> - Blind Carbon Copy additional recipients on the email.
