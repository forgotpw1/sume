<h1>ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper#link_to</h1>

Creates a link tag of the given +name+ using a URL created by the set of +options+.
See the valid options in the documentation for +url_for+. It's also possible to
pass a String instead of an options hash, which generates a link tag that uses the
value of the String as the href for the link. Using a <tt>:back</tt> Symbol instead
of an options hash will generate a link to the referrer (a JavaScript back link
will be used in place of a referrer if none exists). If +nil+ is passed as the name
the value of the link itself will become the name.

==== Signatures

  link_to(body, url, html_options = {})
    # url is a String; you can use URL helpers like
    # posts_path

  link_to(body, url_options = {}, html_options = {})
    # url_options, except :confirm or :method,
    # is passed to url_for

  link_to(options = {}, html_options = {}) do
    # name
  end

  link_to(url, html_options = {}) do
    # name
  end

==== Options
* <tt>:confirm => 'question?'</tt> - This will allow the unobtrusive JavaScript
  driver to prompt with the question specified. If the user accepts, the link is
  processed normally, otherwise no action is taken.
* <tt>:method => symbol of HTTP verb</tt> - This modifier will dynamically
  create an HTML form and immediately submit the form for processing using
  the HTTP verb specified. Useful for having links perform a POST operation
  in dangerous actions like deleting a record (which search bots can follow
  while spidering your site). Supported verbs are <tt>:post</tt>, <tt>:delete</tt>, <tt>:patch</tt>, and <tt>:put</tt>.
  Note that if the user has JavaScript disabled, the request will fall back
  to using GET. If <tt>:href => '#'</tt> is used and the user has JavaScript
  disabled clicking the link will have no effect. If you are relying on the
  POST behavior, you should check for it in your controller's action by using
  the request object's methods for <tt>post?</tt>, <tt>delete?</tt>, <tt>:patch</tt>, or <tt>put?</tt>.
* <tt>:remote => true</tt> - This will allow the unobtrusive JavaScript
  driver to make an Ajax request to the URL in question instead of following
  the link. The drivers each provide mechanisms for listening for the
  completion of the Ajax request and performing JavaScript operations once
  they're complete

==== Examples
Because it relies on +url_for+, +link_to+ supports both older-style controller/action/id arguments
and newer RESTful routes. Current Rails style favors RESTful routes whenever possible, so base
your application on resources and use

  link_to "Profile", profile_path(@profile)
  # => <a href="/profiles/1">Profile</a>

or the even pithier

  link_to "Profile", @profile
  # => <a href="/profiles/1">Profile</a>

in place of the older more verbose, non-resource-oriented

  link_to "Profile", :controller => "profiles", :action => "show", :id => @profile
  # => <a href="/profiles/show/1">Profile</a>

Similarly,

  link_to "Profiles", profiles_path
  # => <a href="/profiles">Profiles</a>

is better than

  link_to "Profiles", :controller => "profiles"
  # => <a href="/profiles">Profiles</a>

You can use a block as well if your link target is hard to fit into the name parameter. ERB example:

  <%= link_to(@profile) do %>
    <strong><%= @profile.name %></strong> -- <span>Check it out!</span>
  <% end %>
  # => <a href="/profiles/1">
         <strong>David</strong> -- <span>Check it out!</span>
       </a>

Classes and ids for CSS are easy to produce:

  link_to "Articles", articles_path, :id => "news", :class => "article"
  # => <a href="/articles" class="article" id="news">Articles</a>

Be careful when using the older argument style, as an extra literal hash is needed:

  link_to "Articles", { :controller => "articles" }, :id => "news", :class => "article"
  # => <a href="/articles" class="article" id="news">Articles</a>

Leaving the hash off gives the wrong link:

  link_to "WRONG!", :controller => "articles", :id => "news", :class => "article"
  # => <a href="/articles/index/news?class=article">WRONG!</a>

+link_to+ can also produce links with anchors or query strings:

  link_to "Comment wall", profile_path(@profile, :anchor => "wall")
  # => <a href="/profiles/1#wall">Comment wall</a>

  link_to "Ruby on Rails search", :controller => "searches", :query => "ruby on rails"
  # => <a href="/searches?query=ruby+on+rails">Ruby on Rails search</a>

  link_to "Nonsense search", searches_path(:foo => "bar", :baz => "quux")
  # => <a href="/searches?foo=bar&amp;baz=quux">Nonsense search</a>

The two options specific to +link_to+ (<tt>:confirm</tt> and <tt>:method</tt>) are used as follows:

  link_to "Visit Other Site", "http://www.rubyonrails.org/", :confirm => "Are you sure?"
  # => <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" data-confirm="Are you sure?"">Visit Other Site</a>

  link_to("Destroy", "http://www.example.com", :method => :delete, :confirm => "Are you sure?")
  # => <a href='http://www.example.com' rel="nofollow" data-method="delete" data-confirm="Are you sure?">Destroy</a>
