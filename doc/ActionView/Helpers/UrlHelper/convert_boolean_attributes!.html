<h1>ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper#convert_boolean_attributes!</h1>

Processes the +html_options+ hash, converting the boolean
attributes from true/false form into the form required by
HTML/XHTML. (An attribute is considered to be boolean if
its name is listed in the given +bool_attrs+ array.)

More specifically, for each boolean attribute in +html_options+
given as:

  "attr" => bool_value

if the associated +bool_value+ evaluates to true, it is
replaced with the attribute's name; otherwise the attribute is
removed from the +html_options+ hash. (See the XHTML 1.0 spec,
section 4.5 "Attribute Minimization" for more:
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.5)

Returns the updated +html_options+ hash, which is also modified
in place.

Example:

  convert_boolean_attributes!( html_options,
                               %w( checked disabled readonly ) )
