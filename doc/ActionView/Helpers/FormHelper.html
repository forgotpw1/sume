Form helpers are designed to make working with resources much easier
compared to using vanilla HTML.

Typically, a form designed to create or update a resource reflects the
identity of the resource in several ways: (i) the url that the form is
sent to (the form element's +action+ attribute) should result in a request
being routed to the appropriate controller action (with the appropriate <tt>:id</tt>
parameter in the case of an existing resource), (ii) input fields should
be named in such a way that in the controller their values appear in the
appropriate places within the +params+ hash, and (iii) for an existing record,
when the form is initially displayed, input fields corresponding to attributes
of the resource should show the current values of those attributes.

In Rails, this is usually achieved by creating the form using +form_for+ and
a number of related helper methods. +form_for+ generates an appropriate <tt>form</tt>
tag and yields a form builder object that knows the model the form is about.
Input fields are created by calling methods defined on the form builder, which
means they are able to generate the appropriate names and default values
corresponding to the model attributes, as well as convenient IDs, etc.
Conventions in the generated field names allow controllers to receive form data
nicely structured in +params+ with no effort on your side.

For example, to create a new person you typically set up a new instance of
+Person+ in the <tt>PeopleController#new</tt> action, <tt>@person</tt>, and
in the view template pass that object to +form_for+:

  <%= form_for @person do |f| %>
    <%= f.label :first_name %>:
    <%= f.text_field :first_name %><br />

    <%= f.label :last_name %>:
    <%= f.text_field :last_name %><br />

    <%= f.submit %>
  <% end %>

The HTML generated for this would be (modulus formatting):

  <form action="/people" class="new_person" id="new_person" method="post">
    <div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline">
      <input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="NrOp5bsjoLRuK8IW5+dQEYjKGUJDe7TQoZVvq95Wteg=" />
    </div>
    <label for="person_first_name">First name</label>:
    <input id="person_first_name" name="person[first_name]" type="text" /><br />

    <label for="person_last_name">Last name</label>:
    <input id="person_last_name" name="person[last_name]" type="text" /><br />

    <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Create Person" />
  </form>

As you see, the HTML reflects knowledge about the resource in several spots,
like the path the form should be submitted to, or the names of the input fields.

In particular, thanks to the conventions followed in the generated field names, the
controller gets a nested hash <tt>params[:person]</tt> with the person attributes
set in the form. That hash is ready to be passed to <tt>Person.create</tt>:

  if @person = Person.create(params[:person])
    # success
  else
    # error handling
  end

Interestingly, the exact same view code in the previous example can be used to edit
a person. If <tt>@person</tt> is an existing record with name "John Smith" and ID 256,
the code above as is would yield instead:

  <form action="/people/256" class="edit_person" id="edit_person_256" method="post">
    <div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline">
      <input name="_method" type="hidden" value="put" />
      <input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="NrOp5bsjoLRuK8IW5+dQEYjKGUJDe7TQoZVvq95Wteg=" />
    </div>
    <label for="person_first_name">First name</label>:
    <input id="person_first_name" name="person[first_name]" type="text" value="John" /><br />

    <label for="person_last_name">Last name</label>:
    <input id="person_last_name" name="person[last_name]" type="text" value="Smith" /><br />

    <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Update Person" />
  </form>

Note that the endpoint, default values, and submit button label are tailored for <tt>@person</tt>.
That works that way because the involved helpers know whether the resource is a new record or not,
and generate HTML accordingly.

The controller would receive the form data again in <tt>params[:person]</tt>, ready to be
passed to <tt>Person#update_attributes</tt>:

  if @person.update_attributes(params[:person])
    # success
  else
    # error handling
  end

That's how you typically work with resources.
