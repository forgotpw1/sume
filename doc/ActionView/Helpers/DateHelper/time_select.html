<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#time_select</h1>

Returns a set of select tags (one for hour, minute and optionally second) pre-selected for accessing a
specified time-based attribute (identified by +method+) on an object assigned to the template (identified by
+object+). You can include the seconds with <tt>:include_seconds</tt>. You can get hours in the AM/PM format
with <tt>:ampm</tt> option.

This method will also generate 3 input hidden tags, for the actual year, month and day unless the option
<tt>:ignore_date</tt> is set to +true+. If you set the <tt>:ignore_date</tt> to +true+, you must have a
+date_select+ on the same method within the form otherwise an exception will be raised.

If anything is passed in the html_options hash it will be applied to every select tag in the set.

  # Creates a time select tag that, when POSTed, will be stored in the article variable in the sunrise attribute.
  time_select("article", "sunrise")

  # Creates a time select tag with a seconds field that, when POSTed, will be stored in the article variables in
  # the sunrise attribute.
  time_select("article", "start_time", :include_seconds => true)

  # You can set the <tt>:minute_step</tt> to 15 which will give you: 00, 15, 30 and 45.
  time_select 'game', 'game_time', {:minute_step => 15}

  # Creates a time select tag with a custom prompt. Use <tt>:prompt => true</tt> for generic prompts.
  time_select("article", "written_on", :prompt => {:hour => 'Choose hour', :minute => 'Choose minute', :second => 'Choose seconds'})
  time_select("article", "written_on", :prompt => {:hour => true}) # generic prompt for hours
  time_select("article", "written_on", :prompt => true) # generic prompts for all

  # You can set :ampm option to true which will show the hours as: 12 PM, 01 AM .. 11 PM.
  time_select 'game', 'game_time', {:ampm => true}

The selects are prepared for multi-parameter assignment to an Active Record object.

Note: If the day is not included as an option but the month is, the day will be set to the 1st to ensure that
all month choices are valid.
