<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#distance_of_time_in_words</h1>


<p>Reports the approximate distance in time between two Time, Date or DateTime
objects or integers as seconds. Set <tt>include_seconds</tt> to true if you
want more detailed approximations when distance &lt; 1 min, 29 secs.
Distances are reported based on the following table:</p>

<p>With <tt>include_seconds</tt> = true and the difference &lt; 1 minute 29
seconds:</p>

<pre>0-4   secs      # =&gt; less than 5 seconds
5-9   secs      # =&gt; less than 10 seconds
10-19 secs      # =&gt; less than 20 seconds

40-59 secs      # =&gt; less than a minute
