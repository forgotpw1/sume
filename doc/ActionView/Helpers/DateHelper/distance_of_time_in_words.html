<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#distance_of_time_in_words</h1>

Reports the approximate distance in time between two Time, Date or DateTime objects or integers as seconds.
Pass <tt>:include_seconds => true</tt> if you want more detailed approximations when distance < 1 min, 29 secs.
Distances are reported based on the following table:

  0 <-> 29 secs                                                             # => less than a minute
  30 secs <-> 1 min, 29 secs                                                # => 1 minute
  1 min, 30 secs <-> 44 mins, 29 secs                                       # => [2..44] minutes
  44 mins, 30 secs <-> 89 mins, 29 secs                                     # => about 1 hour
  89 mins, 30 secs <-> 23 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs                             # => about [2..24] hours
  23 hrs, 59 mins, 30 secs <-> 41 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs                     # => 1 day
  41 hrs, 59 mins, 30 secs  <-> 29 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs           # => [2..29] days
  29 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 30 secs <-> 44 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs   # => about 1 month
  44 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 30 secs <-> 59 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs   # => about 2 months
  59 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 30 secs <-> 1 yr minus 1 sec                    # => [2..12] months
  1 yr <-> 1 yr, 3 months                                                   # => about 1 year
  1 yr, 3 months <-> 1 yr, 9 months                                         # => over 1 year
  1 yr, 9 months <-> 2 yr minus 1 sec                                       # => almost 2 years
  2 yrs <-> max time or date                                                # => (same rules as 1 yr)

With <tt>:include_seconds => true</tt> and the difference < 1 minute 29 seconds:
  0-4   secs      # => less than 5 seconds
  5-9   secs      # => less than 10 seconds
  10-19 secs      # => less than 20 seconds
  20-39 secs      # => half a minute
  40-59 secs      # => less than a minute
  60-89 secs      # => 1 minute
