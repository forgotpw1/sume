<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#date_select</h1>

Returns a set of select tags (one for year, month, and day) pre-selected for accessing a specified date-based
attribute (identified by +method+) on an object assigned to the template (identified by +object+).


==== Options
* <tt>:use_month_numbers</tt> - Set to true if you want to use month numbers rather than month names (e.g.
  "2" instead of "February").
* <tt>:use_two_digit_numbers</tt> - Set to true if you want to display two digit month and day numbers (e.g.
  "02" instead of "February" and "08" instead of "8").
* <tt>:use_short_month</tt>   - Set to true if you want to use abbreviated month names instead of full
  month names (e.g. "Feb" instead of "February").
* <tt>:add_month_numbers</tt>  - Set to true if you want to use both month numbers and month names (e.g.
  "2 - February" instead of "February").
* <tt>:use_month_names</tt>   - Set to an array with 12 month names if you want to customize month names.
  Note: You can also use Rails' i18n functionality for this.
* <tt>:date_separator</tt>    - Specifies a string to separate the date fields. Default is "" (i.e. nothing).
* <tt>:start_year</tt>        - Set the start year for the year select. Default is <tt>Time.now.year - 5</tt>.
* <tt>:end_year</tt>          - Set the end year for the year select. Default is <tt>Time.now.year + 5</tt>.
* <tt>:discard_day</tt>       - Set to true if you don't want to show a day select. This includes the day
  as a hidden field instead of showing a select field. Also note that this implicitly sets the day to be the
  first of the given month in order to not create invalid dates like 31 February.
* <tt>:discard_month</tt>     - Set to true if you don't want to show a month select. This includes the month
  as a hidden field instead of showing a select field. Also note that this implicitly sets :discard_day to true.
* <tt>:discard_year</tt>      - Set to true if you don't want to show a year select. This includes the year
  as a hidden field instead of showing a select field.
* <tt>:order</tt>             - Set to an array containing <tt>:day</tt>, <tt>:month</tt> and <tt>:year</tt> to
  customize the order in which the select fields are shown. If you leave out any of the symbols, the respective
  select will not be shown (like when you set <tt>:discard_xxx => true</tt>. Defaults to the order defined in
  the respective locale (e.g. [:year, :month, :day] in the en locale that ships with Rails).
* <tt>:include_blank</tt>     - Include a blank option in every select field so it's possible to set empty
  dates.
* <tt>:default</tt>           - Set a default date if the affected date isn't set or is nil.
* <tt>:disabled</tt>          - Set to true if you want show the select fields as disabled.
* <tt>:prompt</tt>            - Set to true (for a generic prompt), a prompt string or a hash of prompt strings
  for <tt>:year</tt>, <tt>:month</tt>, <tt>:day</tt>, <tt>:hour</tt>, <tt>:minute</tt> and <tt>:second</tt>.
  Setting this option prepends a select option with a generic prompt  (Day, Month, Year, Hour, Minute, Seconds)
  or the given prompt string.

If anything is passed in the +html_options+ hash it will be applied to every select tag in the set.

NOTE: Discarded selects will default to 1. So if no month select is available, January will be assumed.

  date_select("article", "written_on")

  # Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute,
  # with the year in the year drop down box starting at 1995.

  # Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute,
  # with the year in the year drop down box starting at 1995, numbers used for months instead of words,
  # and without a day select box.
  date_select("article", "written_on", :start_year => 1995, :use_month_numbers => true,
                                    :discard_day => true, :include_blank => true)

  # Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute

  # Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute

  date_select("article", "written_on", :prompt => { :day => 'Select day', :month => 'Select month', :year => 'Select year' })

The selects are prepared for multi-parameter assignment to an Active Record object.

Note: If the day is not included as an option but the month is, the day will be set to the 1st to ensure that
all month choices are valid.
