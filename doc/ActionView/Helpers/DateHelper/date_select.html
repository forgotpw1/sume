<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#date_select</h1>


<p>Returns a set of select tags (one for year, month, and day) pre-selected
for accessing a specified date-based attribute (identified by
<tt>method</tt>) on an object assigned to the template (identified by
<tt>object</tt>).</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:use_month_numbers</tt> - Set to true if you want to use month numbers
rather than month names (e.g. "2" instead of "February").</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:use_short_month</tt>   - Set to true if you want to use abbreviated
month names instead of full month names (e.g. "Feb" instead of "February").</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:add_month_numbers</tt>  - Set to true if you want to use both month
numbers and month names (e.g. "2 - February" instead of "February").</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:use_month_names</tt>   - Set to an array with 12 month names if you
want to customize month names. Note: You can also use Rails' i18n
functionality for this.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:date_separator</tt>    - Specifies a string to separate the date
fields. Default is "" (i.e. nothing).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:start_year</tt>        - Set the start year for the year select.
Default is <tt>Time.now.year - 5</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:end_year</tt>          - Set the end year for the year select. Default
is <tt>Time.now.year + 5</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:discard_day</tt>       - Set to true if you don't want to show a day
select. This includes the day as a hidden field instead of showing a select
field. Also note that this implicitly sets the day to be the first of the
given month in order to not create invalid dates like 31 February.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:discard_month</tt>     - Set to true if you don't want to show a month
select. This includes the month as a hidden field instead of showing a
select field. Also note that this implicitly sets :discard_day to true.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:discard_year</tt>      - Set to true if you don't want to show a year
select. This includes the year as a hidden field instead of showing a
select field.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:order</tt>             - Set to an array containing <tt>:day</tt>,
<tt>:month</tt> and <tt>:year</tt> to customize the order in which the
select fields are shown. If you leave out any of the symbols, the
respective select will not be shown (like when you set <tt>:discard_xxx
=&gt; true</tt>. Defaults to the order defined in the respective locale
(e.g. [:year, :month, :day] in the en locale that ships with Rails).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:include_blank</tt>     - Include a blank option in every select field
so it's possible to set empty dates.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:default</tt>           - Set a default date if the affected date isn't
set or is nil.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:disabled</tt>          - Set to true if you want show the select
fields as disabled.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:prompt</tt>            - Set to true (for a generic prompt), a prompt
string or a hash of prompt strings for <tt>:year</tt>, <tt>:month</tt>,
<tt>:day</tt>, <tt>:hour</tt>, <tt>:minute</tt> and <tt>:second</tt>.
Setting this option prepends a select option with a generic prompt  (Day,
Month, Year, Hour, Minute, Seconds) or the given prompt string.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If anything is passed in the <tt>html_options</tt> hash it will be applied
to every select tag in the set.</p>

<p>NOTE: Discarded selects will default to 1. So if no month select is
available, January will be assumed.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre># Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute.
date_select(&quot;article&quot;, &quot;written_on&quot;)

# Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute,
# with the year in the year drop down box starting at 1995.
date_select(&quot;article&quot;, &quot;written_on&quot;, :start_year =&gt; 1995)

# Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute,
# with the year in the year drop down box starting at 1995, numbers used for months instead of words,
# and without a day select box.
date_select(&quot;article&quot;, &quot;written_on&quot;, :start_year =&gt; 1995, :use_month_numbers =&gt; true,
                                  :discard_day =&gt; true, :include_blank =&gt; true)

# Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute
# with the fields ordered as day, month, year rather than month, day, year.
date_select(&quot;article&quot;, &quot;written_on&quot;, :order =&gt; [:day, :month, :year])

# Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the user variable, in the birthday attribute
# lacking a year field.
date_select(&quot;user&quot;, &quot;birthday&quot;, :order =&gt; [:month, :day])

# Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the article variable, in the written_on attribute
# which is initially set to the date 3 days from the current date
date_select(&quot;article&quot;, &quot;written_on&quot;, :default =&gt; 3.days.from_now)

# Generates a date select that when POSTed is stored in the credit_card variable, in the bill_due attribute
# that will have a default day of 20.
date_select(&quot;credit_card&quot;, &quot;bill_due&quot;, :default =&gt; { :day =&gt; 20 })

# Generates a date select with custom prompts.
date_select(&quot;article&quot;, &quot;written_on&quot;, :prompt =&gt; { :day =&gt; 'Select day', :month =&gt; 'Select month', :year =&gt; 'Select year' })</pre>

<p>The selects are prepared for multi-parameter assignment to an Active Record
object.</p>

<p>Note: If the day is not included as an option but the month is, the day
will be set to the 1st to ensure that all month choices are valid.</p>
