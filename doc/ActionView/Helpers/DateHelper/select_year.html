<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#select_year</h1>


<p>Returns a select tag with options for each of the five years on each side
of the current, which is selected. The five year radius can be changed
using the <tt>:start_year</tt> and <tt>:end_year</tt> keys in the
<tt>options</tt>. Both ascending and descending year lists are supported by
making <tt>:start_year</tt> less than or greater than <tt>:end_year</tt>.
The <tt>date</tt> can also be substituted for a year given as a number.
Override the field name using the <tt>:field_name</tt> option, 'year' by
default.</p>
