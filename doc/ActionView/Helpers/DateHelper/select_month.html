<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#select_month</h1>

Returns a select tag with options for each of the months January through December with the current month
selected. The month names are presented as keys (what's shown to the user) and the month numbers (1-12) are
used as values (what's submitted to the server). It's also possible to use month numbers for the presentation
instead of names -- set the <tt>:use_month_numbers</tt> key in +options+ to true for this to happen. If you
want both numbers and names, set the <tt>:add_month_numbers</tt> key in +options+ to true. If you would prefer
to show month names as abbreviations, set the <tt>:use_short_month</tt> key in +options+ to true. If you want
to use your own month names, set the <tt>:use_month_names</tt> key in +options+ to an array of 12 month names.
If you want to display months with a leading zero set the <tt>:use_two_digit_numbers</tt> key in +options+ to true.
Override the field name using the <tt>:field_name</tt> option, 'month' by default.
