<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#select_month</h1>


<p>Returns a select tag with options for each of the months January through
December with the current month selected. The month names are presented as
keys (what's shown to the user) and the month numbers (1-12) are used as
values (what's submitted to the server). It's also possible to use month
numbers for the presentation instead of names -- set the
<tt>:use_month_numbers</tt> key in <tt>options</tt> to true for this to
happen. If you want both numbers and names, set the
<tt>:add_month_numbers</tt> key in <tt>options</tt> to true. If you would
prefer to show month names as abbreviations, set the
<tt>:use_short_month</tt> key in <tt>options</tt> to true. If you want to
use your own month names, set the <tt>:use_month_names</tt> key in
<tt>options</tt> to an array of 12 month names. Override the field name
using the <tt>:field_name</tt> option, 'month' by default.</p>
