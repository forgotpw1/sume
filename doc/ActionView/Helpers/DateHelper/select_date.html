<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#select_date</h1>


<p>Returns a set of html select-tags (one for year, month, and day)
pre-selected with the <tt>date</tt>. It's possible to explicitly set the
order of the tags using the <tt>:order</tt> option with an array of symbols
<tt>:year</tt>, <tt>:month</tt> and <tt>:day</tt> in the desired order. If
the array passed to the <tt>:order</tt> option does not contain all the
three symbols, all tags will be hidden.</p>

<p>If anything is passed in the html_options hash it will be applied to every
select tag in the set.</p>
