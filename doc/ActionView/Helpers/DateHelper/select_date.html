<h1>ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper#select_date</h1>

Returns a set of html select-tags (one for year, month, and day) pre-selected with the +date+.
It's possible to explicitly set the order of the tags using the <tt>:order</tt> option with an array of
symbols <tt>:year</tt>, <tt>:month</tt> and <tt>:day</tt> in the desired order.
If the array passed to the <tt>:order</tt> option does not contain all the three symbols, all tags will be hidden.

If anything is passed in the html_options hash it will be applied to every select tag in the set.

  my_date = Time.now + 6.days
