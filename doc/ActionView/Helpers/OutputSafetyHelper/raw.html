<h1>ActionView::Helpers::OutputSafetyHelper#raw</h1>

This method outputs without escaping a string. Since escaping tags is
now default, this can be used when you don't want Rails to automatically
escape tags. This is not recommended if the data is coming from the user's
input.

For example:

<%=raw @user.name %>
