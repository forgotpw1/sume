<h1>ActionView::Helpers::RenderingHelper#_layout_for</h1>


<p>Overwrites _layout_for in the context object so it supports the case a
block is passed to a partial. Returns the contents that are yielded to a
layout, given a name or a block.</p>

<p>You can think of a layout as a method that is called with a block. If the
user calls <tt>yield :some_name</tt>, the block, by default, returns
<tt>content_for(:some_name)</tt>. If the user calls simply <tt>yield</tt>,
the default block returns <tt>content_for(:layout)</tt>.</p>

<p>The user can override this default by passing a block to the layout:</p>

<pre># The template
&lt;%= render :layout =&gt; &quot;my_layout&quot; do %&gt;
  Content
&lt;% end %&gt;

# The layout
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>In this case, instead of the default block, which would return
<tt>content_for(:layout)</tt>, this method returns the block that was
passed in to <tt>render :layout</tt>, and the response would be</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  Content
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>Finally, the block can take block arguments, which can be passed in by
<tt>yield</tt>:</p>

<pre># The template
&lt;%= render :layout =&gt; &quot;my_layout&quot; do |customer| %&gt;
  Hello &lt;%= customer.name %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

# The layout
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;%= yield Struct.new(:name).new(&quot;David&quot;) %&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>In this case, the layout would receive the block passed into <tt>render
:layout</tt>, and the struct specified would be passed into the block as an
argument. The result would be</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  Hello David
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
