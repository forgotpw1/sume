<h1>ActionView::Helpers::RenderingHelper#_layout_for</h1>

Overwrites _layout_for in the context object so it supports the case a block is
passed to a partial. Returns the contents that are yielded to a layout, given a
name or a block.

You can think of a layout as a method that is called with a block. If the user calls
<tt>yield :some_name</tt>, the block, by default, returns <tt>content_for(:some_name)</tt>.
If the user calls simply +yield+, the default block returns <tt>content_for(:layout)</tt>.

The user can override this default by passing a block to the layout:

  # The template
  <%= render :layout => "my_layout" do %>
    Content
  <% end %>

  # The layout
  <html>
    <%= yield %>
  </html>

In this case, instead of the default block, which would return <tt>content_for(:layout)</tt>,
this method returns the block that was passed in to <tt>render :layout</tt>, and the response
would be

  <html>
    Content
  </html>

Finally, the block can take block arguments, which can be passed in by +yield+:

  # The template
  <%= render :layout => "my_layout" do |customer| %>
    Hello <%= customer.name %>
  <% end %>

  # The layout
  <html>
    <%= yield Struct.new(:name).new("David") %>
  </html>

In this case, the layout would receive the block passed into <tt>render :layout</tt>,
and the struct specified would be passed into the block as an argument. The result
would be

  <html>
    Hello David
  </html>
