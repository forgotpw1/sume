Provides a number of methods for creating form tags that doesn't rely on an Active Record object assigned to the template like
FormHelper does. Instead, you provide the names and values manually.

NOTE: The HTML options <tt>disabled</tt>, <tt>readonly</tt>, and <tt>multiple</tt> can all be treated as booleans. So specifying
<tt>:disabled => true</tt> will give <tt>disabled="disabled"</tt>.
