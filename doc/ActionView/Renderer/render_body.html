<h1>ActionView::Renderer#render_body</h1>


<p>Render but returns a valid Rack body. If fibers are defined, we return a
streaming body that renders the template piece by piece.</p>

<p>Note that partials are not supported to be rendered with streaming, so in
such cases, we just wrap them in an array.</p>
