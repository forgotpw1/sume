<h1>ERB::Util.j</h1>

A utility method for escaping HTML entities in JSON strings
using \uXXXX JavaScript escape sequences for string literals:

  json_escape('is a > 0 & a < 10?')
  # => is a \u003E 0 \u0026 a \u003C 10?

Note that after this operation is performed the output is not
valid JSON. In particular double quotes are removed:

  json_escape('{"name":"john","created_at":"2010-04-28T01:39:31Z","id":1}')
  # => {name:john,created_at:2010-04-28T01:39:31Z,id:1}

This method is also aliased as +j+, and available as a helper
in Rails templates:

  <%=j @person.to_json %>
