Extensions to the built-in Ruby logger.

If you want to use the default log formatter as defined in the Ruby core, then you
will need to set the formatter for the logger as in:

  logger.formatter = Formatter.new

You can then specify the datetime format, for example:

  logger.datetime_format = "%Y-%m-%d"

Note: This logger is deprecated in favor of ActiveSupport::BufferedLogger
