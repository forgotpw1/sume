It is recommended to use <tt>class_attribute</tt> over methods defined in this file. Please
refer to documentation for <tt>class_attribute</tt> for more information. Officially it is not
deprecated but <tt>class_attribute</tt> is faster.

Allows attributes to be shared within an inheritance hierarchy. Each descendant gets a copy of
their parents' attributes, instead of just a pointer to the same. This means that the child can add elements
to, for example, an array without those additions being shared with either their parent, siblings, or
children. This is unlike the regular class-level attributes that are shared across the entire hierarchy.

The copies of inheritable parent attributes are added to subclasses when they are created, via the
+inherited+ hook.

 class Person
   class_inheritable_accessor :hair_colors
 end

 Person.hair_colors = [:brown, :black, :blonde, :red]
 Person.hair_colors     # => [:brown, :black, :blonde, :red]
 Person.new.hair_colors # => [:brown, :black, :blonde, :red]

To opt out of the instance writer method, pass :instance_writer => false.
To opt out of the instance reader method, pass :instance_reader => false.

  class Person
    class_inheritable_accessor :hair_colors :instance_writer => false, :instance_reader => false
  end

  Person.new.hair_colors = [:brown]  # => NoMethodError
  Person.new.hair_colors             # => NoMethodError
