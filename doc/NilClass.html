Extensions to +nil+ which allow for more helpful error messages for people who
are new to Rails.

Ruby raises NoMethodError if you invoke a method on an object that does not
respond to it:

  $ ruby -e nil.destroy
  -e:1: undefined method `destroy' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)

With these extensions, if the method belongs to the public interface of the
classes in NilClass::WHINERS the error message suggests which could be the
actual intended class:

  $ rails runner nil.destroy
  ...
  You might have expected an instance of ActiveRecord::Base.
  ...

NilClass#id exists in Ruby 1.8 (though it is deprecated). Since +id+ is a fundamental
method of Active Record models NilClass#id is redefined as well to raise a RuntimeError
and warn the user. She probably wanted a model database identifier and the 4
returned by the original method could result in obscure bugs.

The flag <tt>config.whiny_nils</tt> determines whether this feature is enabled.
By default it is on in development and test modes, and it is off in production
mode.
