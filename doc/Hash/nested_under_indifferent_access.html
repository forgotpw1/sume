<h1>Hash#nested_under_indifferent_access</h1>


<p>Returns an <tt>ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess</tt> out of its receiver:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">{:a =&gt; 1}.with_indifferent_access[&quot;a&quot;] # =&gt; 1</pre>

<p>Called when object is nested under an object that receives
#with_indifferent_access. This method will be called on the current object
by the enclosing object and is aliased to #with_indifferent_access by
default. Subclasses of Hash may overwrite this method to return
<tt>self</tt> if converting to an
<tt>ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess</tt> would not be desirable.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">b = {:b =&gt; 1}
{:a =&gt; b}.with_indifferent_access[&quot;a&quot;] # calls b.nested_under_indifferent_access</pre>
