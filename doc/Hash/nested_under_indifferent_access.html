<h1>Hash#nested_under_indifferent_access</h1>

Returns an <tt>ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess</tt> out of its receiver:

  {:a => 1}.with_indifferent_access["a"] # => 1

Called when object is nested under an object that receives
#with_indifferent_access. This method will be called on the current object
by the enclosing object and is aliased to #with_indifferent_access by
default. Subclasses of Hash may overwrite this method to return +self+ if
converting to an <tt>ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess</tt> would not be
desirable.

  b = {:b => 1}
  {:a => b}.with_indifferent_access["a"] # calls b.nested_under_indifferent_access
