<h1>Hash#except</h1>


<p>Return a hash that includes everything but the given keys. This is useful
for limiting a set of parameters to everything but a few known toggles:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">@person.update_attributes(params[:person].except(:admin))</pre>

<p>If the receiver responds to <tt>convert_key</tt>, the method is called on
each of the arguments. This allows <tt>except</tt> to play nice with hashes
with indifferent access for instance:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">{:a =&gt; 1}.with_indifferent_access.except(:a)  # =&gt; {}
{:a =&gt; 1}.with_indifferent_access.except(&quot;a&quot;) # =&gt; {}</pre>
