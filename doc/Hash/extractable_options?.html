<h1>Hash#extractable_options?</h1>

By default, only instances of Hash itself are extractable.
Subclasses of Hash may implement this method and return
true to declare themselves as extractable. If a Hash
is extractable, Array#extract_options! pops it from
the Array when it is the last element of the Array.
