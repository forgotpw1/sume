<h1>String#mb_chars</h1>


<h2>Multibyte proxy</h2>

<p><tt>mb_chars</tt> is a multibyte safe proxy for string methods.</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.8 and older it creates and returns an instance of the
ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Chars class which encapsulates the original
string. A Unicode safe version of all the String methods are defined on
this proxy class. If the proxy class doesn’t respond to a certain method,
it’s forwarded to the encapsulated string.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">name = 'Claus Müller'
name.reverse # =&gt; &quot;rell??M sualC&quot;
name.length  # =&gt; 13

name.mb_chars.reverse.to_s # =&gt; &quot;rellüM sualC&quot;
name.mb_chars.length       # =&gt; 12</pre>

<p>In Ruby 1.9 and newer <tt>mb_chars</tt> returns <tt>self</tt> because
String is (mostly) encoding aware. This means that it becomes easy to run
one version of your code on multiple Ruby versions.</p>

<h2>Method chaining</h2>

<p>All the methods on the Chars proxy which normally return a string will
return a Chars object. This allows method chaining on the result of any of
these methods.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">name.mb_chars.reverse.length # =&gt; 12</pre>

<h2>Interoperability and configuration</h2>

<p>The Chars object tries to be as interchangeable with String objects as
possible: sorting and comparing between String and Char work like expected.
The bang! methods change the internal string representation in the Chars
object. Interoperability problems can be resolved easily with a
<tt>to_s</tt> call.</p>

<p>For more information about the methods defined on the Chars proxy see
ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Chars. For information about how to change the
default Multibyte behavior see ActiveSupport::Multibyte.</p>
