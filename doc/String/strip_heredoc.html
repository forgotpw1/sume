<h1>String#strip_heredoc</h1>


<p>Strips indentation in heredocs.</p>

<p>For example in</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">if options[:usage]
  puts &lt;&lt;-USAGE.strip_heredoc
    This command does such and such.

    Supported options are:
      -h         This message
      ...
  USAGE
end</pre>

<p>the user would see the usage message aligned against the left margin.</p>

<p>Technically, it looks for the least indented line in the whole string, and
removes that amount of leading whitespace.</p>
