<h1>String#camelize</h1>

By default, +camelize+ converts strings to UpperCamelCase. If the argument to camelize
is set to <tt>:lower</tt> then camelize produces lowerCamelCase.

+camelize+ will also convert '/' to '::' which is useful for converting paths to namespaces.

  'active_record'.camelize                # => "ActiveRecord"
  'active_record'.camelize(:lower)        # => "activeRecord"
  'active_record/errors'.camelize         # => "ActiveRecord::Errors"
  'active_record/errors'.camelize(:lower) # => "activeRecord::Errors"
