<h1>BigDecimal#as_json</h1>


<p>A BigDecimal would be naturally represented as a JSON number. Most
libraries, however, parse non-integer JSON numbers directly as floats.
Clients using those libraries would get in general a wrong number and no
way to recover other than manually inspecting the string with the JSON code
itself.</p>

<p>That's why a JSON string is returned. The JSON literal is not numeric, but
if the other end knows by contract that the data is supposed to be a
BigDecimal, it still has the chance to post-process the string and get the
real value.</p>
