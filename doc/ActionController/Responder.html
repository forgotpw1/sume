Responsible for exposing a resource to different mime requests,
usually depending on the HTTP verb. The responder is triggered when
<code>respond_with</code> is called. The simplest case to study is a GET request:

  class PeopleController < ApplicationController
    respond_to :html, :xml, :json

    def index
      @people = Person.find(:all)
      respond_with(@people)
    end
  end

When a request comes in, for example for an XML response, three steps happen:

  1) the responder searches for a template at people/index.xml;

  2) if the template is not available, it will invoke <code>#to_xml</code> on the given resource;

  3) if the responder does not <code>respond_to :to_xml</code>, call <code>#to_format</code> on it.

=== Builtin HTTP verb semantics

The default \Rails responder holds semantics for each HTTP verb. Depending on the
content type, verb and the resource status, it will behave differently.

Using \Rails default responder, a POST request for creating an object could
be written as:

  def create
    @user = User.new(params[:user])
    flash[:notice] = 'User was successfully created.' if @user.save
    respond_with(@user)
  end

Which is exactly the same as:

  def create
    @user = User.new(params[:user])

    respond_to do |format|
      if @user.save
        flash[:notice] = 'User was successfully created.'
        format.html { redirect_to(@user) }
        format.xml { render :xml => @user, :status => :created, :location => @user }
      else
        format.html { render :action => "new" }
        format.xml { render :xml => @user.errors, :status => :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end

The same happens for PUT and DELETE requests.

=== Nested resources

You can supply nested resources as you do in <code>form_for</code> and <code>polymorphic_url</code>.
Consider the project has many tasks example. The create action for
TasksController would be like:

  def create
    @project = Project.find(params[:project_id])
    @task = @project.comments.build(params[:task])
    flash[:notice] = 'Task was successfully created.' if @task.save
    respond_with(@project, @task)
  end

Giving several resources ensures that the responder will redirect to
<code>project_task_url</code> instead of <code>task_url</code>.

Namespaced and singleton resources require a symbol to be given, as in
polymorphic urls. If a project has one manager which has many tasks, it
should be invoked as:

  respond_with(@project, :manager, @task)

Note that if you give an array, it will be treated as a collection,
so the following is not equivalent:

  respond_with [@project, :manager, @task]

=== Custom options

<code>respond_with</code> also allow you to pass options that are forwarded
to the underlying render call. Those options are only applied success
scenarios. For instance, you can do the following in the create method above:

  def create
    @project = Project.find(params[:project_id])
    @task = @project.comments.build(params[:task])
    flash[:notice] = 'Task was successfully created.' if @task.save
    respond_with(@project, @task, :status => 201)
  end

This will return status 201 if the task was saved with success. If not,
it will simply ignore the given options and return status 422 and the
resource errors. To customize the failure scenario, you can pass a
a block to <code>respond_with</code>:

  def create
    @project = Project.find(params[:project_id])
    @task = @project.comments.build(params[:task])
    respond_with(@project, @task, :status => 201) do |format|
      if @task.save
        flash[:notice] = 'Task was successfully created.'
      else
        format.html { render "some_special_template" }
      end
    end
  end

Using <code>respond_with</code> with a block follows the same syntax as <code>respond_to</code>.
