<h1>ActionController::Responder#display</h1>

Display is just a shortcut to render a resource with the current format.

  display @user, :status => :ok

For XML requests it's equivalent to:

  render :xml => @user, :status => :ok

Options sent by the user are also used:

  respond_with(@user, :status => :created)
  display(@user, :status => :ok)

Results in:

  render :xml => @user, :status => :created
