<h1>ActionController::Redirecting#redirect_to</h1>


<p>Redirects the browser to the target specified in <tt>options</tt>. This
parameter can take one of three forms:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>Hash</tt> - The URL will be generated by calling url_for with the
<tt>options</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Record</tt> - The URL will be generated by calling url_for with the
<tt>options</tt>, which will reference a named URL for that record.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>String</tt> starting with <tt>protocol://</tt> (like <tt>http://</tt>)
- Is passed straight through as the target for redirection.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>String</tt> not containing a protocol - The current protocol and host
is prepended to the string.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Proc</tt> - A block that will be executed in the controller's context.
Should return any option accepted by <tt>redirect_to</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:back</tt> - Back to the page that issued the request. Useful for forms
that are triggered from multiple places. Short-hand for
<tt>redirect_to(request.env["HTTP_REFERER"])</tt></p>
</li></ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">redirect_to :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :id =&gt; 5
redirect_to post
redirect_to &quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org&quot;
redirect_to &quot;/images/screenshot.jpg&quot;
redirect_to articles_url
redirect_to :back
redirect_to proc { edit_post_url(@post) }</pre>

<p>The redirection happens as a "302 Moved" header unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">redirect_to post_url(@post), :status =&gt; :found
redirect_to :action=&gt;'atom', :status =&gt; :moved_permanently
redirect_to post_url(@post), :status =&gt; 301
redirect_to :action=&gt;'atom', :status =&gt; 302</pre>

<p>The status code can either be a standard <a
href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes">HTTP Status
code</a> as an integer, or a symbol representing the downcased, underscored
and symbolized description. Note that the status code must be a 3xx HTTP
code, or redirection will not occur.</p>

<p>It is also possible to assign a flash message as part of the redirection.
There are two special accessors for the commonly used flash names
<tt>alert</tt> and <tt>notice</tt> as well as a general purpose
<tt>flash</tt> bucket.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">redirect_to post_url(@post), :alert =&gt; &quot;Watch it, mister!&quot;
redirect_to post_url(@post), :status=&gt; :found, :notice =&gt; &quot;Pay attention to the road&quot;
redirect_to post_url(@post), :status =&gt; 301, :flash =&gt; { :updated_post_id =&gt; @post.id }
redirect_to { :action=&gt;'atom' }, :alert =&gt; &quot;Something serious happened&quot;</pre>

<p>When using <tt>redirect_to :back</tt>, if there is no referrer,
RedirectBackError will be raised. You may specify some fallback behavior
for this case by rescuing RedirectBackError.</p>
