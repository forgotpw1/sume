<h1>ActionController::ParamsWrapper::ClassMethods#_default_wrap_model</h1>


<p>Determine the wrapper model from the controller's name. By convention, this
could be done by trying to find the defined model that has the same
singularize name as the controller. For example, <tt>UsersController</tt>
will try to find if the <tt>User</tt> model exists.</p>

<p>This method also does namespace lookup. Foo::Bar::UsersController will try
to find Foo::Bar::User, Foo::User and finally User.</p>
