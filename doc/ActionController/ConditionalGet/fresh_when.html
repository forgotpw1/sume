<h1>ActionController::ConditionalGet#fresh_when</h1>

Sets the etag, last_modified, or both on the response and renders a
<tt>304 Not Modified</tt> response if the request is already fresh.

Parameters:
* <tt>:etag</tt>
* <tt>:last_modified</tt>
* <tt>:public</tt> By default the Cache-Control header is private, set this to true if you want your application to be cachable by other devices (proxy caches).

Example:

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    fresh_when(:etag => @article, :last_modified => @article.created_at, :public => true)
  end

This will render the show template if the request isn't sending a matching etag or
If-Modified-Since header and just a <tt>304 Not Modified</tt> response if there's a match.

You can also just pass a record where last_modified will be set by calling updated_at and the etag by passing the object itself. Example:

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    fresh_when(@article)
  end

When passing a record, you can still set whether the public header:

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    fresh_when(@article, :public => true)
  end
