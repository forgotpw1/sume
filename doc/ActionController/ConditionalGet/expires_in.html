<h1>ActionController::ConditionalGet#expires_in</h1>

Sets a HTTP 1.1 Cache-Control header. Defaults to issuing a <tt>private</tt> instruction, so that
intermediate caches must not cache the response.

  expires_in 20.minutes
  expires_in 3.hours, :public => true
  expires_in 3.hours, :public => true, :must_revalidate => true

This method will overwrite an existing Cache-Control header.
See http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html for more possibilities.

The method will also ensure a HTTP Date header for client compatibility.
