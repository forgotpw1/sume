<h1>ActionController::TemplateAssertions#assert_template</h1>

Asserts that the request was rendered with the appropriate template file or partials.

  # assert that the "new" view template was rendered
  assert_template "new"

  # assert that the exact template "admin/posts/new" was rendered
  assert_template %r{\Aadmin/posts/new\Z}

  # assert that the layout 'admin' was rendered
  assert_template :layout => 'admin'
  assert_template :layout => 'layouts/admin'
  assert_template :layout => :admin

  # assert that no layout was rendered
  assert_template :layout => nil
  assert_template :layout => false

  # assert that the "_customer" partial was rendered twice
  assert_template :partial => '_customer', :count => 2

  # assert that no partials were rendered
  assert_template :partial => false

In a view test case, you can also assert that specific locals are passed
to partials:

  # assert that the "_customer" partial was rendered with a specific object
  assert_template :partial => '_customer', :locals => { :customer => @customer }
