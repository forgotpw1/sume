<h1>ActionController::TemplateAssertions#assert_template</h1>


<p>Asserts that the request was rendered with the appropriate template file or
partials.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre data-language="ruby"># assert that the &quot;new&quot; view template was rendered
assert_template &quot;new&quot;

# assert that the &quot;_customer&quot; partial was rendered twice
assert_template :partial =&gt; '_customer', :count =&gt; 2

# assert that no partials were rendered
assert_template :partial =&gt; false</pre>

<p>In a view test case, you can also assert that specific locals are passed to
partials:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby"># assert that the &quot;_customer&quot; partial was rendered with a specific object
assert_template :partial =&gt; '_customer', :locals =&gt; { :customer =&gt; @customer }</pre>
