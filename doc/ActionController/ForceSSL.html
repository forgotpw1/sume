This module provides a method which will redirect browser to use HTTPS
protocol. This will ensure that user's sensitive information will be
transferred safely over the internet. You _should_ always force browser
to use HTTPS when you're transferring sensitive information such as
user authentication, account information, or credit card information.

Note that if you are really concerned about your application security,
you might consider using +config.force_ssl+ in your config file instead.
That will ensure all the data transferred via HTTPS protocol and prevent
user from getting session hijacked when accessing the site under unsecured
HTTP protocol.
