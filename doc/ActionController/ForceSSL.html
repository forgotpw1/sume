This module provides a method which will redirects browser to use HTTPS
protocol. This will ensure that user's sensitive information will be
transferred safely over the internet. You _should_ always force browser
to use HTTPS when you're transferring sensitive information such as
user authentication, account information, or credit card information.

Note that if you really concern about your application safety, you might
consider using +config.force_ssl+ in your configuration config file instead.
That will ensure all the data transferred via HTTPS protocol and prevent
user from getting session hijacked when accessing the site under unsecured
HTTP protocol.
