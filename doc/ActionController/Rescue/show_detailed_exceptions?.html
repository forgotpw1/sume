<h1>ActionController::Rescue#show_detailed_exceptions?</h1>

Override this method if you want to customize when detailed
exceptions must be shown. This method is only called when
consider_all_requests_local is false. By default, it returns
false, but someone may set it to `request.local?` so local
requests in production still shows the detailed exception pages.
