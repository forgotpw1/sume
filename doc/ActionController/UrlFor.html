Includes +url_for+ into the host class. The class has to provide a +RouteSet+ by implementing
the <tt>_routes</tt> method. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.

In addition to <tt>AbstractController::UrlFor</tt>, this module accesses the HTTP layer to define
url options like the +host+. In order to do so, this module requires the host class
to implement +env+ and +request+, which need to be a Rack-compatible.

  class RootUrl
    include ActionController::UrlFor
    include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers

    delegate :env, :request, :to => :controller

    def initialize(controller)
      @controller = controller
      @url        = root_path # named route from the application.
    end
  end
