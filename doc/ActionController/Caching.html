\Caching is a cheap way of speeding up slow applications by keeping the result of
calculations, renderings, and database calls around for subsequent requests.
Action Controller affords you three approaches in varying levels of granularity:
Page, Action, Fragment.

You can read more about each approach and the sweeping assistance by clicking the
modules below.

Note: To turn off all caching and sweeping, set
  config.action_controller.perform_caching = false.

== \Caching stores

All the caching stores from ActiveSupport::Cache are available to be used as backends
for Action Controller caching. This setting only affects action and fragment caching
as page caching is always written to disk.

Configuration examples (MemoryStore is the default):

  config.action_controller.cache_store = :memory_store
  config.action_controller.cache_store = :file_store, "/path/to/cache/directory"
  config.action_controller.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, "localhost"
  config.action_controller.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, Memcached::Rails.new("localhost:11211")
  config.action_controller.cache_store = MyOwnStore.new("parameter")
