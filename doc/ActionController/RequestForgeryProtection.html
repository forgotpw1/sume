Controller actions are protected from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
by including a token in the rendered html for your application. This token is
stored as a random string in the session, to which an attacker does not have
access. When a request reaches your application, \Rails verifies the received
token with the token in the session. Only HTML and JavaScript requests are checked,
so this will not protect your XML API (presumably you'll have a different
authentication scheme there anyway). Also, GET requests are not protected as these
should be idempotent.

CSRF protection is turned on with the <tt>protect_from_forgery</tt> method,
which checks the token and resets the session if it doesn't match what was expected.
A call to this method is generated for new \Rails applications by default.
You can customize the error message by editing public/422.html.

The token parameter is named <tt>authenticity_token</tt> by default. The name and
value of this token must be added to every layout that renders forms by including
<tt>csrf_meta_tags</tt> in the html +head+.

on Rails Security Guide[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html].
