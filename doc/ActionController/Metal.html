<tt>ActionController::Metal</tt> is the simplest possible controller, providing a
valid Rack interface without the additional niceties provided by
<tt>ActionController::Base</tt>.

A sample metal controller might look like this:

  class HelloController < ActionController::Metal
    def index
      self.response_body = "Hello World!"
    end
  end

And then to route requests to your metal controller, you would add
something like this to <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>:

  match 'hello', :to => HelloController.action(:index)

The +action+ method returns a valid Rack application for the \Rails
router to dispatch to.

== Rendering Helpers

<tt>ActionController::Metal</tt> by default provides no utilities for rendering
views, partials, or other responses aside from explicitly calling of
<tt>response_body=</tt>, <tt>content_type=</tt>, and <tt>status=</tt>. To
add the render helpers you're used to having in a normal controller, you
can do the following:

  class HelloController < ActionController::Metal
    include ActionController::Rendering
    append_view_path "#{Rails.root}/app/views"

    def index
      render "hello/index"
    end
  end

== Redirection Helpers

To add redirection helpers to your metal controller, do the following:

  class HelloController < ActionController::Metal
    include ActionController::Redirecting
    include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers

    def index
      redirect_to root_url
    end
  end

== Other Helpers

You can refer to the modules included in <tt>ActionController::Base</tt> to see
other features you can bring into your metal controller.
