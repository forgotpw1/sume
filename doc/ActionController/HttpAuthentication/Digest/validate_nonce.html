<h1>ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Digest#validate_nonce</h1>

Might want a shorter timeout depending on whether the request
is a PATCH, PUT, or POST, and if client is browser or web service.
Can be much shorter if the Stale directive is implemented. This would
allow a user to use new nonce without prompting user again for their
username and password.
