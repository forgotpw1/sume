<h1>ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Digest#expected_response</h1>

Returns the expected response for a request of +http_method+ to +uri+ with the decoded +credentials+ and the expected +password+
Optional parameter +password_is_ha1+ is set to +true+ by default, since best practice is to store ha1 digest instead
of a plain-text password.
