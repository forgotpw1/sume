Makes it dead easy to do HTTP \Digest authentication.

=== Simple \Digest example

  require 'digest/md5'
  class PostsController < ApplicationController
    REALM = "SuperSecret"
    USERS = => "secret", #plain text password
             "dap" => Digest::MD5.hexdigest(["dap",REALM,"secret"].join(":"))  #ha1 digest password

    before_filter :authenticate, :except => [:index]

    def index
      render :text => "Everyone can see me!"
    end

    def edit
      render :text => "I'm only accessible if you know the password"
    end

    private
      def authenticate
        authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest(REALM) do |username|
          USERS[username]
        end
      end
  end

=== Notes

The +authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest+ block must return the user's password
or the ha1 digest hash so the framework can appropriately hash to check the user's
credentials. Returning +nil+ will cause authentication to fail.

Storing the ha1 hash: MD5(username:realm:password), is better than storing a plain password. If
the password file or database is compromised, the attacker would be able to use the ha1 hash to
authenticate as the user at this +realm+, but would not have the user's password to try using at
other sites.

In rare instances, web servers or front proxies strip authorization headers before
they reach your application. You can debug this situation by logging all environment
variables, and check for HTTP_AUTHORIZATION, amongst others.
