Makes it dead easy to do HTTP \Basic and \Digest authentication.

=== Simple \Basic example

  class PostsController < ApplicationController
    http_basic_authenticate_with :name => "dhh", :password => "secret", :except => :index

    def index
      render :text => "Everyone can see me!"
    end

    def edit
      render :text => "I'm only accessible if you know the password"
    end
 end

=== Advanced \Basic example

Here is a more advanced \Basic example where only Atom feeds and the XML API is protected by HTTP authentication,
the regular HTML interface is protected by a session approach:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter :set_account, :authenticate

    protected
      def set_account
        @account = Account.find_by_url_name(request.subdomains.first)
      end

      def authenticate
        case request.format
        when Mime::XML, Mime::ATOM
          if user = authenticate_with_http_basic { |u, p| @account.users.authenticate(u, p) }
            @current_user = user
          else
            request_http_basic_authentication
          end
        else
          if session_authenticated?
            @current_user = @account.users.find(session[:authenticated][:user_id])
          else
            redirect_to(login_url) and return false
          end
        end
      end
  end

In your integration tests, you can do something like this:

  def test_access_granted_from_xml
    get(
      "/notes/1.xml", nil,
      'HTTP_AUTHORIZATION' => ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Basic.encode_credentials(users(:dhh).name, users(:dhh).password)
    )

    assert_equal 200, status
  end

=== Simple \Digest example

  require 'digest/md5'
  class PostsController < ApplicationController
    REALM = "SuperSecret"
    USERS = {"dhh" => "secret", #plain text password
             "dap" => Digest::MD5.hexdigest(["dap",REALM,"secret"].join(":"))  #ha1 digest password

    before_filter :authenticate, :except => [:index]

    def index
      render :text => "Everyone can see me!"
    end

    def edit
      render :text => "I'm only accessible if you know the password"
    end

    private
      def authenticate
        authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest(REALM) do |username|
          USERS[username]
        end
      end
  end

=== Notes

The +authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest+ block must return the user's password
or the ha1 digest hash so the framework can appropriately hash to check the user's
credentials. Returning +nil+ will cause authentication to fail.

Storing the ha1 hash: MD5(username:realm:password), is better than storing a plain password. If
the password file or database is compromised, the attacker would be able to use the ha1 hash to
authenticate as the user at this +realm+, but would not have the user's password to try using at
other sites.

In rare instances, web servers or front proxies strip authorization headers before
they reach your application. You can debug this situation by logging all environment
variables, and check for HTTP_AUTHORIZATION, amongst others.
