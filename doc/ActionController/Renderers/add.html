<h1>ActionController::Renderers.add</h1>

Adds a new renderer to call within controller actions.
A renderer is invoked by passing its name as an option to
<tt>AbstractController::Rendering#render</tt>. To create a renderer
pass it a name and a block. The block takes two arguments, the first
is the value paired with its key and the second is the remaining
hash of options passed to +render+.

Create a csv renderer:

  ActionController::Renderers.add :csv do |obj, options|
    filename = options[:filename] || 'data'
    str = obj.respond_to?(:to_csv) ? obj.to_csv : obj.to_s
    send_data str, :type => Mime::CSV,
      :disposition => "attachment; filename=#{filename}.csv"
  end

Note that we used Mime::CSV for the csv mime type as it comes with Rails.
For a custom renderer, you'll need to register a mime type with
<tt>Mime::Type.register</tt>.

To use the csv renderer in a controller action:

  def show
    @csvable = Csvable.find(params[:id])
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.csv { render :csv => @csvable, :filename => @csvable.name }
    }
  end
To use renderers and their mime types in more concise ways, see
<tt>ActionController::MimeResponds::ClassMethods.respond_to</tt> and
<tt>ActionController::MimeResponds#respond_with</tt>
