<h1>ActionController::Head#head</h1>

Return a response that has no content (merely headers). The options
argument is interpreted to be a hash of header names and values.
This allows you to easily return a response that consists only of
significant headers:

  head :created, :location => person_path(@person)

  head :created, :location => @person

It can also be used to return exceptional conditions:

  return head(:method_not_allowed) unless request.post?
  return head(:bad_request) unless valid_request?
  render
