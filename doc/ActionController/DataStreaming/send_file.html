<h1>ActionController::DataStreaming#send_file</h1>

Sends the file. This uses a server-appropriate method (such as X-Sendfile)
via the Rack::Sendfile middleware. The header to use is set via
+config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header+.
Your server can also configure this for you by setting the X-Sendfile-Type header.

Be careful to sanitize the path parameter if it is coming from a web
page. <tt>send_file(params[:path])</tt> allows a malicious user to
download any file on your server.

Options:
* <tt>:filename</tt> - suggests a filename for the browser to use.
  Defaults to <tt>File.basename(path)</tt>.
* <tt>:type</tt> - specifies an HTTP content type.
  You can specify either a string or a symbol for a registered type register with
  <tt>Mime::Type.register</tt>, for example :json
  If omitted, type will be guessed from the file extension specified in <tt>:filename</tt>.
  If no content type is registered for the extension, default type 'application/octet-stream' will be used.
* <tt>:disposition</tt> - specifies whether the file will be shown inline or downloaded.
  Valid values are 'inline' and 'attachment' (default).
* <tt>:status</tt> - specifies the status code to send with the response. Defaults to 200.
* <tt>:url_based_filename</tt> - set to +true+ if you want the browser guess the filename from
  the URL, which is necessary for i18n filenames on certain browsers
  (setting <tt>:filename</tt> overrides this option).

The default Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers are
set to download arbitrary binary files in as many browsers as
possible. IE versions 4, 5, 5.5, and 6 are all known to have
a variety of quirks (especially when downloading over SSL).

Simple download:

  send_file '/path/to.zip'

Show a JPEG in the browser:

  send_file '/path/to.jpeg', :type => 'image/jpeg', :disposition => 'inline'

Show a 404 page in the browser:

  send_file '/path/to/404.html', :type => 'text/html; charset=utf-8', :status => 404

Read about the other Content-* HTTP headers if you'd like to
provide the user with more information (such as Content-Description) in
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11.

Also be aware that the document may be cached by proxies and browsers.
The Pragma and Cache-Control headers declare how the file may be cached
by intermediaries. They default to require clients to validate with
the server before releasing cached responses. See
http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/ for an overview of web caching and
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9
for the Cache-Control header spec.
