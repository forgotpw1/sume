The \Rails framework provides a large number of helpers for working with assets, dates, forms,
numbers and model objects, to name a few. These helpers are available to all templates
by default.

In addition to using the standard template helpers provided, creating custom helpers to
extract complicated logic or reusable functionality is strongly encouraged. By default, each controller
will include all helpers.

In previous versions of \Rails the controller will include a helper whose
name matches that of the controller, e.g., <tt>MyController</tt> will automatically
include <tt>MyHelper</tt>. To return old behavior set +config.action_controller.include_all_helpers+ to +false+.

Additional helpers can be specified using the +helper+ class method in ActionController::Base or any
controller which inherits from it.

The +to_s+ method from the \Time class can be wrapped in a helper method to display a custom message if
a \Time object is blank:

  module FormattedTimeHelper
    def format_time(time, format=:long, blank_message="&nbsp;")
      time.blank? ? blank_message : time.to_s(format)
    end
  end

FormattedTimeHelper can now be included in a controller, using the +helper+ class method:

  class EventsController < ActionController::Base
    helper FormattedTimeHelper
    def index
      @events = Event.all
    end
  end

Then, in any view rendered by <tt>EventController</tt>, the <tt>format_time</tt> method can be called:

  <% @events.each do |event| -%>
    <p>
      <%= format_time(event.time, :short, "N/A") %> | <%= event.name %>
    </p>
  <% end -%>

Finally, assuming we have two event instances, one which has a time and one which does not,
the output might look like this:
