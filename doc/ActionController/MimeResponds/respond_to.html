<h1>ActionController::MimeResponds#respond_to</h1>


<p>Without web-service support, an action which collects the data for
displaying a list of people might look something like this:</p>

<pre>def index
  @people = Person.all
end</pre>

<p>Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:</p>

<pre>def index
  @people = Person.all

  respond_to do |format|
    format.html
    format.xml { render :xml =&gt; @people.to_xml }
  end
end</pre>

<p>What that says is, "if the client wants HTML in response to this action,
just respond as we would have before, but if the client wants XML, return
them the list of people in XML format." (Rails determines the desired
response format from the HTTP Accept header submitted by the client.)</p>

<p>Supposing you have an action that adds a new person, optionally creating
their company (by name) if it does not already exist, without web-services,
it might look like this:</p>

<pre>def create
  @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(params[:company][:name])
  @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])

  redirect_to(person_list_url)
end</pre>

<p>Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:</p>

<pre>def create
  company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
  @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
  @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])

  respond_to do |format|
    format.html { redirect_to(person_list_url) }
    format.js
    format.xml  { render :xml =&gt; @person.to_xml(:include =&gt; @company) }
  end
end</pre>

<p>If the client wants HTML, we just redirect them back to the person list. If
they want JavaScript, then it is an Ajax request and we render the
JavaScript template associated with this action. Lastly, if the client
wants XML, we render the created person as XML, but with a twist: we also
include the person's company in the rendered XML, so you get something like
this:</p>

<pre>&lt;person&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;...&lt;/id&gt;
  ...
  &lt;company&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;...&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;...&lt;/name&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/company&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;</pre>

<p>Note, however, the extra bit at the top of that action:</p>

<pre>company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
@company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])</pre>

<p>This is because the incoming XML document (if a web-service request is in
process) can only contain a single root-node. So, we have to rearrange
things so that the request looks like this (url-encoded):</p>

<pre>person[name]=...&amp;person[company][name]=...&amp;...</pre>

<p>And, like this (xml-encoded):</p>

<pre>&lt;person&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;...&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;company&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;...&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/company&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;</pre>

<p>In other words, we make the request so that it operates on a single
entity's person. Then, in the action, we extract the company data from the
request, find or create the company, and then create the new person with
the remaining data.</p>

<p>Note that you can define your own XML parameter parser which would allow
you to describe multiple entities in a single request (i.e., by wrapping
them all in a single root node), but if you just go with the flow and
accept Rails' defaults, life will be much easier.</p>

<p>If you need to use a MIME type which isn't supported by default, you can
register your own handlers in config/initializers/mime_types.rb as follows.</p>

<pre>Mime::Type.register &quot;image/jpg&quot;, :jpg</pre>

<p>Respond to also allows you to specify a common block for different formats
by using any:</p>

<pre>def index
  @people = Person.all

  respond_to do |format|
    format.html
    format.any(:xml, :json) { render request.format.to_sym =&gt; @people }
  end
end</pre>

<p>In the example above, if the format is xml, it will render:</p>

<pre>render :xml =&gt; @people</pre>

<p>Or if the format is json:</p>

<pre>render :json =&gt; @people</pre>

<p>Since this is a common pattern, you can use the class method respond_to
with the respond_with method to have the same results:</p>

<pre>class PeopleController &lt; ApplicationController
  respond_to :html, :xml, :json

  def index
    @people = Person.all
    respond_with(@person)
  end
end</pre>

<p>Be sure to check respond_with and respond_to documentation for more
examples.</p>
