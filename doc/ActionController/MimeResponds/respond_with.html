<h1>ActionController::MimeResponds#respond_with</h1>


<p>respond_with wraps a resource around a responder for default
representation. First it invokes respond_to, if a response cannot be found
(ie. no block for the request was given and template was not available), it
instantiates an ActionController::Responder with the controller and
resource.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>def index
  @users = User.all
  respond_with(@users)
end</pre>

<p>It also accepts a block to be given. It's used to overwrite a default
response:</p>

<pre>def create
  @user = User.new(params[:user])
  flash[:notice] = &quot;User was successfully created.&quot; if @user.save

  respond_with(@user) do |format|
    format.html { render }
  end
end</pre>

<p>All options given to respond_with are sent to the underlying responder,
except for the option :responder itself. Since the responder interface is
quite simple (it just needs to respond to call), you can even give a proc
to it.</p>

<p>In order to use respond_with, first you need to declare the formats your
controller responds to in the class level with a call to
<tt>respond_to</tt>.</p>
