A container for responses available from the current controller for
requests for different mime-types sent to a particular action.

The public controller methods +respond_with+ and +respond_to+ may be called
with a block that is used to define responses to different mime-types, e.g.
for +respond_to+ :

  respond_to do |format|
    format.html
    format.xml { render :xml => @people }
  end

In this usage, the argument passed to the block (+format+ above) is an
instance of the ActionController::MimeResponds::Collector class. This
object serves as a container in which available responses can be stored by
calling any of the dynamically generated, mime-type-specific methods such
as +html+, +xml+ etc on the Collector. Each response is represented by a
corresponding block if present.

A subsequent call to #negotiate_format(request) will enable the Collector
to determine which specific mime-type it should respond with for the current
request, with this response then being accessible by calling #response.
