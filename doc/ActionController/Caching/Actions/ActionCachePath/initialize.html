<h1>ActionController::Caching::Actions::ActionCachePath#initialize</h1>


<p>If <tt>infer_extension</tt> is true, the cache path extension is looked up
from the request's path and format. This is desirable when reading and
writing the cache, but not when expiring the cache - expire_action should
expire the same files regardless of the request format.</p>
