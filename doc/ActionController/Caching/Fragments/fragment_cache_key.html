<h1>ActionController::Caching::Fragments#fragment_cache_key</h1>

Given a key (as described in <tt>expire_fragment</tt>), returns
a key suitable for use in reading, writing, or expiring a 
cached fragment. If the key is a hash, the generated key is the
return value of url_for on that hash (without the protocol). 
All keys are prefixed with <tt>views/</tt> and uses
ActiveSupport::Cache.expand_cache_key for the expansion.
