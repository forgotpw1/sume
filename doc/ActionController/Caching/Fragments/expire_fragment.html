<h1>ActionController::Caching::Fragments#expire_fragment</h1>


<p>Removes fragments from the cache.</p>

<p><tt>key</tt> can take one of three forms:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>String - This would normally take the form of a path, like
<tt>pages/45/notes</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Hash - Treated as an implicit call to <tt>url_for</tt>, like
<tt>{:controller =&gt; &quot;pages&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;notes&quot;,
:id =&gt; 45}</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p>Regexp - Will remove any fragment that matches, so
<tt>%r{pages/\d*/notes}</tt> might remove all notes. Make sure you don't
use anchors in the regex (<tt>^</tt> or <tt>$</tt>) because the actual
filename matched looks like <tt>./cache/filename/path.cache</tt>. Note:
Regexp expiration is only supported on caches that can iterate over all
keys (unlike memcached).</p>
</li></ul>

<p><tt>options</tt> is passed through to the cache store's <tt>delete</tt>
method (or <tt>delete_matched</tt>, for Regexp keys.)</p>
