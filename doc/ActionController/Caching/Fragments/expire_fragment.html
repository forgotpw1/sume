<h1>ActionController::Caching::Fragments#expire_fragment</h1>

Removes fragments from the cache.

+key+ can take one of three forms:

* String - This would normally take the form of a path, like
  <tt>pages/45/notes</tt>.
* Hash - Treated as an implicit call to +url_for+, like
  <tt>{:controller => "pages", :action => "notes", :id => 45}</tt>
* Regexp - Will remove any fragment that matches, so
  <tt>%r{pages/\d*/notes}</tt> might remove all notes. Make sure you
  don't use anchors in the regex (<tt>^</tt> or <tt>$</tt>) because
  the actual filename matched looks like
  <tt>./cache/filename/path.cache</tt>. Note: Regexp expiration is
  only supported on caches that can iterate over all keys (unlike
  memcached).

+options+ is passed through to the cache store's <tt>delete</tt>
method (or <tt>delete_matched</tt>, for Regexp keys.)
