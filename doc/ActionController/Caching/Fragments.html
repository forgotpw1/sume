Fragment caching is used for caching various blocks within 
views without caching the entire action as a whole. This is
useful when certain elements of an action change frequently or 
depend on complicated state while other parts rarely change or 
can be shared amongst multiple parties. The caching is done using
the <tt>cache</tt> helper available in the Action View. A 
template with fragment caching might look like:

  <b>Hello <%= @name %></b>

  <% cache do %>
    All the topics in the system:
    <%= render :partial => "topic", :collection => Topic.find(:all) %>
  <% end %>

This cache will bind the name of the action that called it, so if
this code was part of the view for the topics/list action, you 
would be able to invalidate it using:
  
  expire_fragment(:controller => "topics", :action => "list")

This default behavior is limited if you need to cache multiple 
fragments per action or if the action itself is cached using 
<tt>caches_action</tt>. To remedy this, there is an option to 
qualify the name of the cached fragment by using the 
<tt>:action_suffix</tt> option:

  <% cache(:action => "list", :action_suffix => "all_topics") do %>

That would result in a name such as 
<tt>/topics/list/all_topics</tt>, avoiding conflicts with the 
action cache and with any fragments that use a different suffix.
Note that the URL doesn't have to really exist or be callable
- the url_for system is just used to generate unique cache names
that we can refer to when we need to expire the cache.

The expiration call for this example is:

  expire_fragment(:controller => "topics", 
                  :action => "list", 
                  :action_suffix => "all_topics")
