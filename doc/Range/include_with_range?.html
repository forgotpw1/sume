<h1>Range#include_with_range?</h1>

Extends the default Range#include? to support range comparisons.
 (1..5).include?(1..5) # => true
 (1..5).include?(2..3) # => true
 (1..5).include?(2..6) # => false

The native Range#include? behavior is untouched.
 ('a'..'f').include?('c') # => true
 (5..9).include?(11) # => false
