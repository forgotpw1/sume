<h1>ActiveSupport::Inflector::Inflections#human</h1>


<p>Specifies a humanized form of a string by a regular expression rule or by a
string mapping. When using a regular expression based replacement, the
normal humanize formatting is called after the replacement. When a string
is used, the human form should be specified as desired (example: 'The
name', not 'the_name')</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">human /_cnt$/i, '\1_count'
human &quot;legacy_col_person_name&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;</pre>
