<h1>ActiveSupport::Inflector::Inflections#human</h1>

Specifies a humanized form of a string by a regular expression rule or by a string mapping.
When using a regular expression based replacement, the normal humanize formatting is called after the replacement.
When a string is used, the human form should be specified as desired (example: 'The name', not 'the_name')

  human /_cnt$/i, '\1_count'
  human "legacy_col_person_name", "Name"
