<h1>ActiveSupport::Inflector::Inflections#irregular</h1>


<p>Specifies a new irregular that applies to both pluralization and
singularization at the same time. This can only be used for strings, not
regular expressions. You simply pass the irregular in singular and plural
form.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">irregular 'octopus', 'octopi'
irregular 'person', 'people'</pre>
