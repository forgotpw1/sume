<h1>ActiveSupport::Inflector::Inflections#acronym</h1>

Specifies a new acronym. An acronym must be specified as it will appear in a camelized string.  An underscore
string that contains the acronym will retain the acronym when passed to `camelize`, `humanize`, or `titleize`.
A camelized string that contains the acronym will maintain the acronym when titleized or humanized, and will
convert the acronym into a non-delimited single lowercase word when passed to +underscore+.

  acronym 'HTML'
  titleize 'html' #=> 'HTML'
  camelize 'html' #=> 'HTML'
  underscore 'MyHTML' #=> 'my_html'

The acronym, however, must occur as a delimited unit and not be part of another word for conversions to recognize it:

  acronym 'HTTP'
  camelize 'my_http_delimited' #=> 'MyHTTPDelimited'
  camelize 'https' #=> 'Https', not 'HTTPs'
  underscore 'HTTPS' #=> 'http_s', not 'https'

  acronym 'HTTPS'
  camelize 'https' #=> 'HTTPS'
  underscore 'HTTPS' #=> 'https'

Note: Acronyms that are passed to `pluralize` will no longer be recognized, since the acronym will not occur as
a delimited unit in the pluralized result. To work around this, you must specify the pluralized form as an
acronym as well:

   acronym 'API'
   camelize(pluralize('api')) #=> 'Apis'

   acronym 'APIs'
   camelize(pluralize('api')) #=> 'APIs'

`acronym` may be used to specify any word that contains an acronym or otherwise needs to maintain a non-standard
capitalization. The only restriction is that the word must begin with a capital letter.

  acronym 'RESTful'
  underscore 'RESTful' #=> 'restful'
  underscore 'RESTfulController' #=> 'restful_controller'
  titleize 'RESTfulController' #=> 'RESTful Controller'
  camelize 'restful' #=> 'RESTful'
  camelize 'restful_controller' #=> 'RESTfulController'

  acronym 'McDonald'
  underscore 'McDonald' #=> 'mcdonald'
  camelize 'mcdonald' #=> 'McDonald'
