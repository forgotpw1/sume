<p>Capitalizes the first word and turns underscores into spaces and strips a
trailing "_id", if any. Like <tt>titleize</tt>, this is meant for creating
pretty output.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">&quot;employee_salary&quot; # =&gt; &quot;Employee salary&quot;
&quot;author_id&quot;       # =&gt; &quot;Author&quot;</pre>
