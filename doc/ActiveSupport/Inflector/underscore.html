<h1>ActiveSupport::Inflector#underscore</h1>

Makes an underscored, lowercase form from the expression in the string.

Changes '::' to '/' to convert namespaces to paths.

  "ActiveModel".underscore         # => "active_model"
  "ActiveModel::Errors".underscore # => "active_model/errors"

As a rule of thumb you can think of +underscore+ as the inverse of +camelize+,
though there are cases where that does not hold:

  "SSLError".underscore.camelize # => "SslError"
