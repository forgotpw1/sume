<h1>ActiveSupport::Inflector#safe_constantize</h1>

Tries to find a constant with the name specified in the argument string:

  "Module".safe_constantize     # => Module
  "Test::Unit".safe_constantize # => Test::Unit

The name is assumed to be the one of a top-level constant, no matter whether
it starts with "::" or not. No lexical context is taken into account:

  C = 'outside'
  module M
    C = 'inside'
    C                    # => 'inside'
    "C".safe_constantize # => 'outside', same as ::C
  end

nil is returned when the name is not in CamelCase or the constant (or part of it) is
unknown.

  "blargle".safe_constantize  # => nil
  "UnknownModule".safe_constantize  # => nil
  "UnknownModule::Foo::Bar".safe_constantize  # => nil
