<h1>ActiveSupport::Inflector#camelize</h1>

By default, +camelize+ converts strings to UpperCamelCase. If the argument to +camelize+
is set to <tt>:lower</tt> then +camelize+ produces lowerCamelCase.

+camelize+ will also convert '/' to '::' which is useful for converting paths to namespaces.

  "active_model".camelize                # => "ActiveModel"
  "active_model".camelize(:lower)        # => "activeModel"
  "active_model/errors".camelize         # => "ActiveModel::Errors"
  "active_model/errors".camelize(:lower) # => "activeModel::Errors"

As a rule of thumb you can think of +camelize+ as the inverse of +underscore+,
though there are cases where that does not hold:

  "SSLError".underscore.camelize # => "SslError"
