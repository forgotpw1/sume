<h1>ActiveSupport::Inflector#constantize</h1>


<p>Tries to find a constant with the name specified in the argument string:</p>

<pre>&quot;Module&quot;.constantize     # =&gt; Module
&quot;Test::Unit&quot;.constantize # =&gt; Test::Unit</pre>

<p>The name is assumed to be the one of a top-level constant, no matter
whether it starts with "::" or not. No lexical context is taken into
account:</p>

<pre>C = 'outside'
module M
  C = 'inside'
  C               # =&gt; 'inside'
  &quot;C&quot;.constantize # =&gt; 'outside', same as ::C
end</pre>

<p>NameError is raised when the name is not in CamelCase or the constant is
unknown.</p>
