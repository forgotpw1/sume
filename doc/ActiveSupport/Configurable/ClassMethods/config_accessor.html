<h1>ActiveSupport::Configurable::ClassMethods#config_accessor</h1>


<p>Allows you to add shortcut so that you don't have to refer to attribute
through config. Also look at the example for config to contrast.</p>

<pre>class User
  include ActiveSupport::Configurable
  config_accessor :allowed_access
end

user = User.new
user.allowed_access = true
user.allowed_access # =&gt; true</pre>
