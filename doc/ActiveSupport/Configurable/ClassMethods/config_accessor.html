<h1>ActiveSupport::Configurable::ClassMethods#config_accessor</h1>

Allows you to add shortcut so that you don't have to refer to attribute through config.
Also look at the example for config to contrast.

  class User
    include ActiveSupport::Configurable
    config_accessor :allowed_access
  end

  user = User.new
  user.allowed_access = true
  user.allowed_access # => true
