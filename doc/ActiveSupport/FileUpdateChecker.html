\FileUpdateChecker specifies the API used by Rails to watch files
and control reloading. The API depends on four methods:

* +initialize+ which expects two parameters and one block as
  described below;

* +updated?+ which returns a boolean if there were updates in
  the filesystem or not;

* +execute+ which executes the given block on initialization
  and updates the latest watched files and timestamp;

* +execute_if_updated+ which just executes the block if it was updated;

After initialization, a call to +execute_if_updated+ must execute
the block only if there was really a change in the filesystem.

== Examples

This class is used by Rails to reload the I18n framework whenever
they are changed upon a new request.

  i18n_reloader = ActiveSupport::FileUpdateChecker.new(paths) do
    I18n.reload!
  end

  ActionDispatch::Reloader.to_prepare do
    i18n_reloader.execute_if_updated
  end
