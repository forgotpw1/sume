<h1>ActiveSupport::BufferedLogger#auto_flushing=</h1>


<p>Set the auto-flush period. Set to true to flush after every log message, to
an integer to flush every N messages, or to false, nil, or zero to never
auto-flush. If you turn auto-flushing off, be sure to regularly flush the
log yourself -- it will eat up memory until you do.</p>
