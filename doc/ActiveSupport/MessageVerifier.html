+MessageVerifier+ makes it easy to generate and verify messages which are signed
to prevent tampering.

This is useful for cases like remember-me tokens and auto-unsubscribe links where the
session store isn't suitable or available.

Remember Me:
  cookies[:remember_me] = @verifier.generate([@user.id, 2.weeks.from_now])

In the authentication filter:

  id, time = @verifier.verify(cookies[:remember_me])
  if time < Time.now
    self.current_user = User.find(id)
  end

By default it uses Marshal to serialize the message. If you want to use another
serialization method, you can set the serializer attribute to something that responds
to dump and load, e.g.:

  @verifier.serializer = YAML
