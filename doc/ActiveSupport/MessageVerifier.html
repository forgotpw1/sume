+MessageVerifier+ makes it easy to generate and verify messages which are signed
to prevent tampering.

This is useful for cases like remember-me tokens and auto-unsubscribe links where the
session store isn't suitable or available.

Remember Me:
  cookies[:remember_me] = @verifier.generate([@user.id, 2.weeks.from_now])

In the authentication filter:

  id, time = @verifier.verify(cookies[:remember_me])
  if time < Time.now
    self.current_user = User.find(id)
  end
