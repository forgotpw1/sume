MessageEncryptor is a simple way to encrypt values which get stored somewhere
you don't trust.

The cipher text and initialization vector are base64 encoded and returned to you.

This can be used in situations similar to the <tt>MessageVerifier</tt>, but where you don't
want users to be able to determine the value of the payload.
