Backtraces often include many lines that are not relevant for the context under review. This makes it hard to find the 
signal amongst the backtrace noise, and adds debugging time. With a BacktraceCleaner, filters and silencers are used to
remove the noisy lines, so that only the most relevant lines remain.

Filters are used to modify lines of data, while silencers are used to remove lines entirely.  The typical filter use case
is to remove lengthy path information from the start of each line, and view file paths relevant to the app directory 
instead of the file system root.  The typical silencer use case is to exclude the output of a noisy library from the 
backtrace, so that you can focus on the rest.

==== Example:

  bc = BacktraceCleaner.new
  bc.add_filter   { |line| line.gsub(Rails.root, '') }
  bc.add_silencer { |line| line =~ /mongrel|rubygems/ }
  bc.clean(exception.backtrace) # will strip the Rails.root prefix and skip any lines from mongrel or rubygems

To reconfigure an existing BacktraceCleaner (like the default one in Rails) and show as much data as possible, you can 
always call <tt>BacktraceCleaner#remove_silencers!</tt>, which will restore the backtrace to a pristine state.  If you 
need to reconfigure an existing BacktraceCleaner so that it does not filter or modify the paths of any lines of the 
backtrace, you can call BacktraceCleaner#remove_filters! These two methods will give you a completely untouched backtrace.
