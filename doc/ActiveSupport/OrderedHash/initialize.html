<h1>ActiveSupport::OrderedHash#initialize</h1>


<p>In MRI the Hash class is core and written in C. In particular, methods are
programmed with explicit C function calls and polymorphism is not honored.</p>

<p>For example, []= is crucial in this implementation to maintain the @keys
array but hash.c invokes rb_hash_aset() originally. This prevents method
reuse through inheritance and forces us to reimplement stuff.</p>

<p>For instance, we cannot use the inherited #merge! because albeit the
algorithm itself would work, our []= is not being called at all by the C
code.</p>
