<h1>ActiveSupport::TimeZone#parse</h1>

Method for creating new ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instance in time zone of +self+ from parsed string.

  Time.zone = "Hawaii"                      # => "Hawaii"
  Time.zone.parse('1999-12-31 14:00:00')    # => Fri, 31 Dec 1999 14:00:00 HST -10:00

If upper components are missing from the string, they are supplied from TimeZone#now:

  Time.zone.now                 # => Fri, 31 Dec 1999 14:00:00 HST -10:00
  Time.zone.parse('22:30:00')   # => Fri, 31 Dec 1999 22:30:00 HST -10:00
