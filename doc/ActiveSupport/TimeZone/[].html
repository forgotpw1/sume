<h1>ActiveSupport::TimeZone.[]</h1>

Locate a specific time zone object. If the argument is a string, it
is interpreted to mean the name of the timezone to locate. If it is a
numeric value it is either the hour offset, or the second offset, of the
timezone to find. (The first one with that offset will be returned.)
Returns +nil+ if no such time zone is known to the system.
