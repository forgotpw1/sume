<h1>ActiveSupport::TimeZone#initialize</h1>


<p>Create a new TimeZone object with the given name and offset. The offset is
the number of seconds that this time zone is offset from UTC (GMT). Seconds
were chosen as the offset unit because that is the unit that Ruby uses to
represent time zone offsets (see Time#utc_offset).</p>
