The order of iteration over hashes in Ruby 1.8 is undefined. For example, you do not know the
order in which +keys+ will return keys, or +each+ yield pairs. <tt>ActiveSupport::OrderedHash</tt>
implements a hash that preserves insertion order, as in Ruby 1.9:

  oh = ActiveSupport::OrderedHash.new
  oh[:a] = 1
  oh[:b] = 2
  oh.keys # => [:a, :b], this order is guaranteed

<tt>ActiveSupport::OrderedHash</tt> is namespaced to prevent conflicts with other implementations.
