<tt>ActiveSupport::OrderedHash</tt> implements a hash that preserves
insertion order.

  oh = ActiveSupport::OrderedHash.new
  oh[:a] = 1
  oh[:b] = 2
  oh.keys # => [:a, :b], this order is guaranteed

Also, maps the +omap+ feature for YAML files
(See http://yaml.org/type/omap.html) to support ordered items
when loading from yaml.

<tt>ActiveSupport::OrderedHash</tt> is namespaced to prevent conflicts
with other implementations.
