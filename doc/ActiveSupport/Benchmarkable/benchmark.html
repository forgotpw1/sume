<h1>ActiveSupport::Benchmarkable#benchmark</h1>


<p>Allows you to measure the execution time of a block in a template and
records the result to the log. Wrap this block around expensive operations
or possible bottlenecks to get a time reading for the operation.  For
example, let's say you thought your file processing method was taking too
long; you could wrap it in a benchmark block.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">&lt;% benchmark &quot;Process data files&quot; do %&gt;
  &lt;%= expensive_files_operation %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>

<p>That would add something like "Process data files (345.2ms)" to the log,
which you can then use to compare timings when optimizing your code.</p>

<p>You may give an optional logger level as the :level option. (:debug, :info,
:warn, :error); the default value is :info.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">&lt;% benchmark &quot;Low-level files&quot;, :level =&gt; :debug do %&gt;
  &lt;%= lowlevel_files_operation %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>

<p>Finally, you can pass true as the third argument to silence all log
activity inside the block. This is great for boiling down a noisy block to
just a single statement:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">&lt;% benchmark &quot;Process data files&quot;, :level =&gt; :info, :silence =&gt; true do %&gt;
  &lt;%= expensive_and_chatty_files_operation %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>
