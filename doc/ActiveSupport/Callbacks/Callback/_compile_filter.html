<h1>ActiveSupport::Callbacks::Callback#_compile_filter</h1>


<p>Filters support:</p>

<pre>Arrays::  Used in conditions. This is used to specify
          multiple conditions. Used internally to
          merge conditions from skip_* filters
Symbols:: A method to call
Strings:: Some content to evaluate
Procs::   A proc to call with the object
Objects:: An object with a before_foo method on it to call</pre>

<p>All of these objects are compiled into methods and handled the same after
this point:</p>

<pre>Arrays::  Merged together into a single filter
Symbols:: Already methods
Strings:: class_eval'ed into methods
Procs::   define_method'ed into methods
Objects::
  a method is created that calls the before_foo method
  on the object.</pre>
