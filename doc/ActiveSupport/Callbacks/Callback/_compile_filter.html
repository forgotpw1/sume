<h1>ActiveSupport::Callbacks::Callback#_compile_filter</h1>

Filters support:

  Arrays::  Used in conditions. This is used to specify
            multiple conditions. Used internally to
            merge conditions from skip_* filters
  Symbols:: A method to call
  Strings:: Some content to evaluate
  Procs::   A proc to call with the object
  Objects:: An object with a before_foo method on it to call

All of these objects are compiled into methods and handled
the same after this point:

  Arrays::  Merged together into a single filter
  Symbols:: Already methods
  Strings:: class_eval'ed into methods
  Procs::   define_method'ed into methods
  Objects::
    a method is created that calls the before_foo method
    on the object.
