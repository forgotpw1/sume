<h1>ActiveSupport::Callbacks#run_callbacks</h1>


<p>Runs the callbacks for the given event.</p>

<p>Calls the before and around callbacks in the order they were set, yields
the block (if given one), and then runs the after callbacks in reverse
order. Optionally accepts a key, which will be used to compile an optimized
callback method for each key. See <tt>ClassMethods.define_callbacks</tt>
for more information.</p>

<p>If the callback chain was halted, returns <tt>false</tt>. Otherwise returns
the result of the block, or <tt>true</tt> if no block is given.</p>
