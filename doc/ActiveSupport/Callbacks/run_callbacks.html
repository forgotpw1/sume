<h1>ActiveSupport::Callbacks#run_callbacks</h1>

Runs the callbacks for the given event.

Calls the before and around callbacks in the order they were set, yields
the block (if given one), and then runs the after callbacks in reverse order.

If the callback chain was halted, returns +false+. Otherwise returns the result
of the block, or +true+ if no block is given.
