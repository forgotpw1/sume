<h1>ActiveSupport::Callbacks::ClassMethods#define_callbacks</h1>


<p>Define sets of events in the object lifecycle that support callbacks.</p>

<pre>define_callbacks :validate
define_callbacks :initialize, :save, :destroy</pre>

<h5>Options</h5>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:terminator</tt> - Determines when a before filter will halt the
callback chain, preventing following callbacks from being called and the
event from being triggered. This is a string to be eval'ed. The result of
the callback is available in the <tt>result</tt> variable.</p>

<pre>define_callbacks :validate, :terminator =&gt; &quot;result == false&quot;</pre>

<p>In this example, if any before validate callbacks returns <tt>false</tt>,
other callbacks are not executed. Defaults to "false", meaning no value
halts the chain.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:rescuable</tt> - By default, after filters are not executed if the
given block or a before filter raises an error. By setting this option to
<tt>true</tt> exception raised by given block is stored and after executing
all the after callbacks the stored exception is raised.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:scope</tt> - Indicates which methods should be executed when an object
is used as a callback.</p>

<pre>class Audit
  def before(caller)
    puts 'Audit: before is called'
  end

  def before_save(caller)
    puts 'Audit: before_save is called'
  end
end

class Account
  include ActiveSupport::Callbacks

  define_callbacks :save
  set_callback :save, :before, Audit.new

  def save
    run_callbacks :save do
      puts 'save in main'
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>In the above case whenever you save an account the method
<tt>Audit#before</tt> will be called. On the other hand</p>

<pre>define_callbacks :save, :scope =&gt; [:kind, :name]</pre>

<p>would trigger <tt>Audit#before_save</tt> instead. That's constructed by
calling <tt>#{kind}_#{name}</tt> on the given instance. In this case "kind"
is "before" and "name" is "save". In this context <tt>:kind</tt> and
<tt>:name</tt> have special meanings: <tt>:kind</tt> refers to the kind of
callback (before/after/around) and <tt>:name</tt> refers to the method on
which callbacks are being defined.</p>

<p>A declaration like</p>

<pre>define_callbacks :save, :scope =&gt; [:name]</pre>

<p>would call <tt>Audit#save</tt>.</p>
</li></ul>
