<h1>ActiveSupport::Callbacks::ClassMethods#define_callbacks</h1>

Define sets of events in the object lifecycle that support callbacks.

  define_callbacks :validate
  define_callbacks :initialize, :save, :destroy

===== Options

* <tt>:terminator</tt> - Determines when a before filter will halt the callback
  chain, preventing following callbacks from being called and the event from being
  triggered. This is a string to be eval'ed. The result of the callback is available
  in the <tt>result</tt> variable.

    define_callbacks :validate, :terminator => "result == false"

  In this example, if any before validate callbacks returns +false+,
  other callbacks are not executed. Defaults to "false", meaning no value
  halts the chain.

* <tt>:skip_after_callbacks_if_terminated</tt> - Determines if after callbacks should be terminated
  by the <tt>:terminator</tt> option. By default after callbacks executed no matter
  if callback chain was terminated or not.
  Option makes sence only when <tt>:terminator</tt> option is specified.

* <tt>:scope</tt> - Indicates which methods should be executed when an object
  is used as a callback.

    class Audit
      def before(caller)
        puts 'Audit: before is called'
      end

      def before_save(caller)
        puts 'Audit: before_save is called'
      end
    end

    class Account
      include ActiveSupport::Callbacks

      define_callbacks :save
      set_callback :save, :before, Audit.new

      def save
        run_callbacks :save do
          puts 'save in main'
        end
      end
    end

  In the above case whenever you save an account the method <tt>Audit#before</tt> will
  be called. On the other hand

    define_callbacks :save, :scope => [:kind, :name]

  would trigger <tt>Audit#before_save</tt> instead. That's constructed by calling
  <tt>#{kind}_#{name}</tt> on the given instance. In this case "kind" is "before" and
  "name" is "save". In this context +:kind+ and +:name+ have special meanings: +:kind+
  refers to the kind of callback (before/after/around) and +:name+ refers to the
  method on which callbacks are being defined.

  A declaration like

    define_callbacks :save, :scope => [:name]

  would call <tt>Audit#save</tt>.
