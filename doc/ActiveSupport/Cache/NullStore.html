A cache store implementation which doesn't actually store anything. Useful in
development and test environments where you don't want caching turned on but
need to go through the caching interface.

This cache does implement the local cache strategy, so values will actually
be cached inside blocks that utilize this strategy. See
ActiveSupport::Cache::Strategy::LocalCache for more details.
