An abstract cache store class. There are multiple cache store
implementations, each having its own additional features. See the classes
under the ActiveSupport::Cache module, e.g.
ActiveSupport::Cache::MemCacheStore. MemCacheStore is currently the most
popular cache store for large production websites.

Some implementations may not support all methods beyond the basic cache
methods of +fetch+, +write+, +read+, +exist?+, and +delete+.

ActiveSupport::Cache::Store can store any serializable Ruby object.

  cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

  cache.read("city")   # => nil
  cache.write("city", "Duckburgh")
  cache.read("city")   # => "Duckburgh"

Keys are always translated into Strings and are case sensitive. When an
object is specified as a key, its +cache_key+ method will be called if it
is defined. Otherwise, the +to_param+ method will be called. Hashes and
Arrays can be used as keys. The elements will be delimited by slashes
and Hashes elements will be sorted by key so they are consistent.

  cache.read("city") == cache.read(:city)   # => true

Nil values can be cached.

If your cache is on a shared infrastructure, you can define a namespace for
your cache entries. If a namespace is defined, it will be prefixed on to every
key. The namespace can be either a static value or a Proc. If it is a Proc, it
will be invoked when each key is evaluated so that you can use application logic
to invalidate keys.

  cache.namespace = lambda { @last_mod_time }  # Set the namespace to a variable
  @last_mod_time = Time.now  # Invalidate the entire cache by changing namespace


Caches can also store values in a compressed format to save space and reduce
time spent sending data. Since there is some overhead, values must be large
enough to warrant compression. To turn on compression either pass
<tt>:compress => true</tt> in the initializer or to +fetch+ or +write+.
To specify the threshold at which to compress values, set
<tt>:compress_threshold</tt>. The default threshold is 32K.
