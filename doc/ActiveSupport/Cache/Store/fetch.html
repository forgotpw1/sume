<h1>ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#fetch</h1>


<p>Fetches data from the cache, using the given key. If there is data in the
cache with the given key, then that data is returned.</p>

<p>If there is no such data in the cache (a cache miss occurred), then nil
will be returned. However, if a block has been passed, then that block will
be run in the event of a cache miss. The return value of the block will be
written to the cache under the given cache key, and that return value will
be returned.</p>

<pre>cache.write(&quot;today&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;)
cache.fetch(&quot;today&quot;)  # =&gt; &quot;Monday&quot;

cache.fetch(&quot;city&quot;)   # =&gt; nil
cache.fetch(&quot;city&quot;) do
  &quot;Duckburgh&quot;
end
cache.fetch(&quot;city&quot;)   # =&gt; &quot;Duckburgh&quot;</pre>

<p>You may also specify additional options via the <tt>options</tt> argument.
Setting <tt>:force =&gt; true</tt> will force a cache miss:</p>

<pre>cache.write(&quot;today&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;)
cache.fetch(&quot;today&quot;, :force =&gt; true)  # =&gt; nil</pre>

<p>Setting <tt>:compress</tt> will store a large cache entry set by the call
in a compressed format.</p>

<p>Setting <tt>:expires_in</tt> will set an expiration time on the cache. All
caches support auto expiring content after a specified number of seconds.
This value can be specified as an option to the construction in which call
all entries will be affected. Or it can be supplied to the <tt>fetch</tt>
or <tt>write</tt> method for just one entry.</p>

<pre>cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new(:expires_in =&gt; 5.minutes)
cache.write(key, value, :expires_in =&gt; 1.minute)  # Set a lower value for one entry</pre>

<p>Setting <tt>:race_condition_ttl</tt> is very useful in situations where a
cache entry is used very frequently and is under heavy load. If a cache
expires and due to heavy load seven different processes will try to read
data natively and then they all will try to write to cache. To avoid that
case the first process to find an expired cache entry will bump the cache
expiration time by the value set in <tt>:race_condition_ttl</tt>. Yes this
process is extending the time for a stale value by another few seconds.
Because of extended life of the previous cache, other processes will
continue to use slightly stale data for a just a big longer. In the
meantime that first process will go ahead and will write into cache the new
value. After that all the processes will start getting new value. The key
is to keep <tt>:race_condition_ttl</tt> small.</p>

<p>If the process regenerating the entry errors out, the entry will be
regenerated after the specified number of seconds. Also note that the life
of stale cache is extended only if it expired recently. Otherwise a new
value is generated and <tt>:race_condition_ttl</tt> does not play any role.</p>

<pre># Set all values to expire after one minute.
cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryCache.new(:expires_in =&gt; 1.minute)

cache.write(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;original value&quot;)
val_1 = nil
val_2 = nil
sleep 60

Thread.new do
  val_1 = cache.fetch(&quot;foo&quot;, :race_condition_ttl =&gt; 10) do
    sleep 1
    &quot;new value 1&quot;
  end
end

Thread.new do
  val_2 = cache.fetch(&quot;foo&quot;, :race_condition_ttl =&gt; 10) do
    &quot;new value 2&quot;
  end
end

# val_1 =&gt; &quot;new value 1&quot;
# val_2 =&gt; &quot;original value&quot;
# sleep 10 # First thread extend the life of cache by another 10 seconds
# cache.fetch(&quot;foo&quot;) =&gt; &quot;new value 1&quot;</pre>

<p>Other options will be handled by the specific cache store implementation.
Internally, #fetch calls #read_entry, and calls #write_entry on a cache
miss. <tt>options</tt> will be passed to the #read and #write calls.</p>

<p>For example, MemCacheStore's #write method supports the <tt>:raw</tt>
option, which tells the memcached server to store all values as strings. We
can use this option with #fetch too:</p>

<pre>cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemCacheStore.new
cache.fetch(&quot;foo&quot;, :force =&gt; true, :raw =&gt; true) do
  :bar
end
cache.fetch(&quot;foo&quot;)  # =&gt; &quot;bar&quot;</pre>
