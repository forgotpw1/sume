The Inflector transforms words from singular to plural, class names to table names, modularized class names to ones without,
and class names to foreign keys. The default inflections for pluralization, singularization, and uncountable words are kept
in inflections.rb.

The Rails core team has stated patches for the inflections library will not be accepted
in order to avoid breaking legacy applications which may be relying on errant inflections.
If you discover an incorrect inflection and require it for your application, you'll need
to correct it yourself (explained below).
