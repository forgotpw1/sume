<h1>ActiveSupport::Dependencies#load_file</h1>

Load the file at the provided path. +const_paths+ is a set of qualified
constant names. When loading the file, Dependencies will watch for the
addition of these constants. Each that is defined will be marked as
autoloaded, and will be removed when Dependencies.clear is next called.

If the second parameter is left off, then Dependencies will construct a set
of names that the file at +path+ may define. See
+loadable_constants_for_path+ for more details.
