<h1>ActiveSupport::Dependencies#new_constants_in</h1>


<p>Run the provided block and detect the new constants that were loaded during
its execution. Constants may only be regarded as 'new' once -- so if the
block calls <tt>new_constants_in</tt> again, then the constants defined
within the inner call will not be reported in this one.</p>

<p>If the provided block does not run to completion, and instead raises an
exception, any new constants are regarded as being only partially defined
and will be removed immediately.</p>
