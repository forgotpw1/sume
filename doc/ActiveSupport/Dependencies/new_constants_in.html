<h1>ActiveSupport::Dependencies#new_constants_in</h1>

Run the provided block and detect the new constants that were loaded during
its execution. Constants may only be regarded as 'new' once -- so if the
block calls +new_constants_in+ again, then the constants defined within the
inner call will not be reported in this one.

If the provided block does not run to completion, and instead raises an
exception, any new constants are regarded as being only partially defined
and will be removed immediately.
