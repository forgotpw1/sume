<h1>ActiveSupport::Dependencies::Loadable#unloadable</h1>


<p>Mark the given constant as unloadable. Unloadable constants are removed
each time dependencies are cleared.</p>

<p>Note that marking a constant for unloading need only be done once. Setup or
init scripts may list each unloadable constant that may need unloading;
each constant will be removed for every subsequent clear, as opposed to for
the first clear.</p>

<p>The provided constant descriptor may be a (non-anonymous) module or class,
or a qualified constant name as a string or symbol.</p>

<p>Returns true if the constant was not previously marked for unloading, false
otherwise.</p>
