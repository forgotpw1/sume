<h1>ActiveSupport::Dependencies#remove_unloadable_constants!</h1>

Remove the constants that have been autoloaded, and those that have been
marked for unloading. Before each constant is removed a callback is sent
to its class/module if it implements +before_remove_const+.

The callback implementation should be restricted to cleaning up caches, etc.
as the environment will be in an inconsistent state, e.g. other constants
may have already been unloaded and not accessible.
