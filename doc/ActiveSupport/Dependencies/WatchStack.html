The WatchStack keeps a stack of the modules being watched as files are loaded.
If a file in the process of being loaded (parent.rb) triggers the load of
another file (child.rb) the stack will ensure that child.rb handles the new
constants.

If child.rb is being autoloaded, its constants will be added to
autoloaded_constants. If it was being `require`d, they will be discarded.

This is handled by walking back up the watch stack and adding the constants
found by child.rb to the list of original constants in parent.rb
