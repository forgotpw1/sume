<h1>ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess#reverse_merge</h1>


<p>Performs the opposite of merge, with the keys and values from the first
hash taking precedence over the second. This overloaded definition prevents
returning a regular hash, if reverse_merge is called on a
<tt>HashWithDifferentAccess</tt>.</p>
