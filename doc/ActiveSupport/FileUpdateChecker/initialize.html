<h1>ActiveSupport::FileUpdateChecker#initialize</h1>

It accepts two parameters on initialization. The first is an array
of files and the second is an optional hash of directories. The hash must
have directories as keys and the value is an array of extensions to be
watched under that directory.

This method must also receive a block that will be called once a path changes.

== Implementation details

This particular implementation checks for added, updated, and removed
files. Directories lookup are compiled to a glob for performance.
Therefore, while someone can add new files to the +files+ array after
initialization (and parts of Rails do depend on this feature), adding
new directories after initialization is not supported.

Notice that other objects that implement the FileUpdateChecker API may
not even allow new files to be added after initialization. If this
is the case, we recommend freezing the +files+ after initialization to
avoid changes that won't make effect.
