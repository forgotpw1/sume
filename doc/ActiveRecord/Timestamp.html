= Active Record Timestamp

Active Record automatically timestamps create and update operations if the
table has fields named <tt>created_at/created_on</tt> or
<tt>updated_at/updated_on</tt>.

Timestamping can be turned off by setting:

  config.active_record.record_timestamps = false

Timestamps are in the local timezone by default but you can use UTC by setting:

  config.active_record.default_timezone = :utc

== Time Zone aware attributes

By default, ActiveRecord::Base keeps all the datetime columns time zone aware by executing following code.

  config.active_record.time_zone_aware_attributes = true

This feature can easily be turned off by assigning value <tt>false</tt> .

If your attributes are time zone aware and you desire to skip time zone conversion to the current Time.zone
when reading certain attributes then you can do following:

  class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
    self.skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes = [:written_on]
  end
