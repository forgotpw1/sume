<h1>ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::Read::ClassMethods#define_method_attribute</h1>

We want to generate the methods via module_eval rather than define_method,
because define_method is slower on dispatch and uses more memory (because it
creates a closure).

But sometimes the database might return columns with characters that are not
allowed in normal method names (like 'my_column(omg)'. So to work around this
we first define with the __temp__ identifier, and then use alias method to
rename it to what we want.
