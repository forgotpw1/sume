<h1>ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::Serialization::ClassMethods#serialize</h1>

If you have an attribute that needs to be saved to the database as an object, and retrieved as the same object,
then specify the name of that attribute using this method and it will be handled automatically.
The serialization is done through YAML. If +class_name+ is specified, the serialized object must be of that
class on retrieval or SerializationTypeMismatch will be raised.

==== Parameters

* +attr_name+ - The field name that should be serialized.
* +class_name+ - Optional, class name that the object type should be equal to.

==== Example
  # Serialize a preferences attribute
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    serialize :preferences
  end
