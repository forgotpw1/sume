<h1>ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::PrimaryKey::ClassMethods#primary_key</h1>

Defines the primary key field -- can be overridden in subclasses. Overwriting will negate any effect of the
primary_key_prefix_type setting, though. Since primary keys are usually protected from mass assignment,
remember to let your database generate them or include the key in +attr_accessible+.
