= Active Record Identity Map

Ensures that each object gets loaded only once by keeping every loaded
object in a map. Looks up objects using the map when referring to them.

More information on Identity Map pattern:

== Configuration

In order to enable IdentityMap, set <tt>config.active_record.identity_map = true</tt>
in your <tt>config/application.rb</tt> file.

IdentityMap is disabled by default and still in development (i.e. use it with care).

== Associations

Active Record Identity Map does not track associations yet. For example:

  comment = @post.comments.first
  comment.post = nil
  @post.comments.include?(comment) #=> true

Ideally, the example above would return false, removing the comment object from the
post association when the association is nullified. This may cause side effects, as
in the situation below, if Identity Map is enabled:

  Post.has_many :comments, :dependent => :destroy

  comment = @post.comments.first
  comment.post = nil
  comment.save
  Post.destroy(@post.id)

Without using Identity Map, the code above will destroy the @post object leaving
the comment object intact. However, once we enable Identity Map, the post loaded
by Post.destroy is exactly the same object as the object @post. As the object @post
still has the comment object in @post.comments, once Identity Map is enabled, the
comment object will be accidently removed.

This inconsistency is meant to be fixed in future Rails releases.
