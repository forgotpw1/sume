<h1>ActiveRecord::ModelSchema::ClassMethods#sequence_name=</h1>

Sets the name of the sequence to use when generating ids to the given
value, or (if the value is nil or false) to the value returned by the
given block. This is required for Oracle and is useful for any
database which relies on sequences for primary key generation.

If a sequence name is not explicitly set when using Oracle or Firebird,
it will default to the commonly used pattern of: #{table_name}_seq

If a sequence name is not explicitly set when using PostgreSQL, it
will discover the sequence corresponding to your primary key for you.

  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    self.sequence_name = "projectseq"   # default would have been "project_seq"
  end
