<h1>ActiveRecord::ModelSchema::ClassMethods#table_name</h1>

Guesses the table name (in forced lower-case) based on the name of the class in the
inheritance hierarchy descending directly from ActiveRecord::Base. So if the hierarchy
looks like: Reply < Message < ActiveRecord::Base, then Message is used
to guess the table name even when called on Reply. The rules used to do the guess
are handled by the Inflector class in Active Support, which knows almost all common
English inflections. You can add new inflections in config/initializers/inflections.rb.

Nested classes are given table names prefixed by the singular form of
the parent's table name. Enclosing modules are not considered.

==== Examples

  class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
  end

  file                  class               table_name
  invoice.rb            Invoice             invoices

  class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
    class Lineitem < ActiveRecord::Base
    end
  end

  file                  class               table_name
  invoice.rb            Invoice::Lineitem   invoice_lineitems

  module Invoice
    class Lineitem < ActiveRecord::Base
    end
  end

  file                  class               table_name
  invoice/lineitem.rb   Invoice::Lineitem   lineitems

Additionally, the class-level +table_name_prefix+ is prepended and the
+table_name_suffix+ is appended. So if you have "myapp_" as a prefix,
the table name guess for an Invoice class becomes "myapp_invoices".
Invoice::Lineitem becomes "myapp_invoice_lineitems".

You can also set your own table name explicitly:

  class Mouse < ActiveRecord::Base
    self.table_name = "mice"
  end

Alternatively, you can override the table_name method to define your
own computation. (Possibly using <tt>super</tt> to manipulate the default
table name.) Example:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    def self.table_name
      "special_" + super
    end
  end
  Post.table_name # => "special_posts"
