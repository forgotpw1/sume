A barebones session store which duck-types with the default session
store but bypasses Active Record and issues SQL directly.  This is
an example session model class meant as a basis for your own classes.

The database connection, table name, and session id and data columns
are configurable class attributes.  Marshaling and unmarshaling
are implemented as class methods that you may override.  By default,
marshaling data is

  ActiveSupport::Base64.encode64(Marshal.dump(data))

and unmarshaling data is

  Marshal.load(ActiveSupport::Base64.decode64(data))

This marshaling behavior is intended to store the widest range of
binary session data in a +text+ column.  For higher performance,
store in a +blob+ column instead and forgo the Base64 encoding.
