<h1>ActiveRecord::TestFixtures::ClassMethods#set_fixture_class</h1>

Sets the model class for a fixture when the class name cannot be inferred from the fixture name.

Examples:

  set_fixture_class :some_fixture        => SomeModel,
                    'namespaced/fixture' => Another::Model

The keys must be the fixture names, that coincide with the short paths to the fixture files.

It is also possible to pass the class name instead of the class:
  set_fixture_class 'some_fixture' => 'SomeModel'
I think this option is redundant, i propose to deprecate it.
Isn't it easier to always pass the class itself?
