Implements the details of eager loading of Active Record associations.

Note that 'eager loading' and 'preloading' are actually the same thing.
However, there are two different eager loading strategies.

The first one is by using table joins. This was only strategy available
prior to Rails 2.1. Suppose that you have an Author model with columns
'name' and 'age', and a Book model with columns 'name' and 'sales'. Using
this strategy, Active Record would try to retrieve all data for an author
and all of its books via a single query:

  SELECT * FROM authors
  LEFT OUTER JOIN books ON authors.id = books.author_id
  WHERE authors.name = 'Ken Akamatsu'

However, this could result in many rows that contain redundant data. After
having received the first row, we already have enough data to instantiate
the Author object. In all subsequent rows, only the data for the joined
'books' table is useful; the joined 'authors' data is just redundant, and
processing this redundant data takes memory and CPU time. The problem
quickly becomes worse and worse as the level of eager loading increases
(i.e. if Active Record is to eager load the associations' associations as
well).

The second strategy is to use multiple database queries, one for each
level of association. Since Rails 2.1, this is the default strategy. In
situations where a table join is necessary (e.g. when the +:conditions+
option references an association's column), it will fallback to the table
join strategy.
