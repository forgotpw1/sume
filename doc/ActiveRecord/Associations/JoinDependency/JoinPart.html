A JoinPart represents a part of a JoinDependency. It is an abstract class, inherited
by JoinBase and JoinAssociation. A JoinBase represents the Active Record which
everything else is being joined onto. A JoinAssociation represents an association which
is joining to the base. A JoinAssociation may result in more than one actual join
operations (for example a has_and_belongs_to_many JoinAssociation would result in
two; one for the join table and one for the target table).
