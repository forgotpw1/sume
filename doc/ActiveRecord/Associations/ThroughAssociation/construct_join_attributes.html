<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::ThroughAssociation#construct_join_attributes</h1>

Construct attributes for :through pointing to owner and associate. This is used by the
methods which create and delete records on the association.

We only support indirectly modifying through associations which has a belongs_to source.
This is the "has_many :tags, :through => :taggings" situation, where the join model
typically has a belongs_to on both side. In other words, associations which could also
be represented as has_and_belongs_to_many associations.

We do not support creating/deleting records on the association where the source has
some other type, because this opens up a whole can of worms, and in basically any
situation it is more natural for the user to just create or modify their join records
directly as required.
