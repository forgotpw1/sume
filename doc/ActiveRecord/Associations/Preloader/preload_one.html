<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader#preload_one</h1>


<p>Not all records have the same class, so group then preload group on the
reflection itself so that if various subclass share the same association
then we do not split them unnecessarily</p>

<p>Additionally, polymorphic belongs_to associations can have multiple
associated classes, depending on the polymorphic_type field. So we group by
the classes as well.</p>
