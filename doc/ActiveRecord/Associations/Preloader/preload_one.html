<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader#preload_one</h1>

Not all records have the same class, so group then preload group on the reflection
itself so that if various subclass share the same association then we do not split
them unnecessarily

Additionally, polymorphic belongs_to associations can have multiple associated
classes, depending on the polymorphic_type field. So we group by the classes as
well.
