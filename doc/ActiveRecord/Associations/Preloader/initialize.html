<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader#initialize</h1>


<p>Eager loads the named associations for the given Active Record record(s).</p>

<p>In this description, 'association name' shall refer to the name passed to
an association creation method. For example, a model that specifies
<tt>belongs_to :author</tt>, <tt>has_many :buyers</tt> has association
names <tt>:author</tt> and <tt>:buyers</tt>.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p><tt>records</tt> is an array of ActiveRecord::Base. This array needs not be
flat, i.e. <tt>records</tt> itself may also contain arrays of records. In
any case, <tt>preload_associations</tt> will preload the all associations
records by flattening <tt>records</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>associations</tt> specifies one or more associations that you want to
preload. It may be:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>a Symbol or a String which specifies a single association name. For
example, specifying <tt>:books</tt> allows this method to preload all books
for an Author.</p>
</li><li>
<p>an Array which specifies multiple association names. This array is
processed recursively. For example, specifying <tt>[:avatar, :books]</tt>
allows this method to preload an author's avatar as well as all of his
books.</p>
</li><li>
<p>a Hash which specifies multiple association names, as well as association
names for the to-be-preloaded association objects. For example, specifying
<tt>{ :author =&gt; :avatar }</tt> will preload a book's author, as well as
that author's avatar.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><tt>:associations</tt> has the same format as the <tt>:include</tt> option
for <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.find</tt>. So <tt>associations</tt> could look
like this:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">:books
[ :books, :author ]
{ :author =&gt; :avatar }
[ :books, { :author =&gt; :avatar } ]</pre>

<p><tt>options</tt> contains options that will be passed to
ActiveRecord::Base#find (which is called under the hood for preloading
records). But it is passed only one level deep in the <tt>associations</tt>
argument, i.e. it's not passed to the child associations when
<tt>associations</tt> is a Hash.</p>
