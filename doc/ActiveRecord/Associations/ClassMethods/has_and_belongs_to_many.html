<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods#has_and_belongs_to_many</h1>


<p>Specifies a many-to-many relationship with another class. This associates
two classes via an intermediate join table.  Unless the join table is
explicitly specified as an option, it is guessed using the lexical order of
the class names. So a join between Developer and Project will give the
default join table name of "developers_projects" because "D" outranks "P".
Note that this precedence is calculated using the <tt>&lt;</tt> operator
for String.  This means that if the strings are of different lengths, and
the strings are equal when compared up to the shortest length, then the
longer string is considered of higher lexical precedence than the shorter
one.  For example, one would expect the tables "paper_boxes" and "papers"
to generate a join table name of "papers_paper_boxes" because of the length
of the name "paper_boxes", but it in fact generates a join table name of
"paper_boxes_papers".  Be aware of this caveat, and use the custom
<tt>:join_table</tt> option if you need to.</p>

<p>The join table should not have a primary key or a model associated with it.
You must manually generate the join table with a migration such as this:</p>

<pre>class CreateDevelopersProjectsJoinTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :developers_projects, :id =&gt; false do |t|
      t.integer :developer_id
      t.integer :project_id
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :developers_projects
  end
end</pre>

<p>Adds the following methods for retrieval and query:</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>collection(force_reload = false)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns an array of all the associated objects. An empty array is returned
if none are found.</p>
</dd><dt>collection&lt;&lt;(object, ...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adds one or more objects to the collection by creating associations in the
join table (<tt>collection.push</tt> and <tt>collection.concat</tt> are
aliases to this method). Note that this operation instantly fires update
sql without waiting for the save or update call on the parent object.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.delete(object, ...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes one or more objects from the collection by removing their
associations from the join table. This does not destroy the objects.</p>
</dd><dt>collection=objects</dt>
<dd>
<p>Replaces the collection's content by deleting and adding objects as
appropriate.</p>
</dd><dt>collection_singular_ids</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns an array of the associated objects' ids.</p>
</dd><dt>collection_singular_ids=ids</dt>
<dd>
<p>Replace the collection by the objects identified by the primary keys in
<tt>ids</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.clear</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes every object from the collection. This does not destroy the
objects.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.empty?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <tt>true</tt> if there are no associated objects.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.size</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the number of associated objects.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.find(id)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Finds an associated object responding to the <tt>id</tt> and that meets the
condition that it has to be associated with this object. Uses the same
rules as ActiveRecord::Base.find.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.exists?(...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Checks whether an associated object with the given conditions exists. Uses
the same rules as ActiveRecord::Base.exists?.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.build(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated with
<tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through the join table, but
has not yet been saved.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.create(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated with
<tt>attributes</tt>, linked to this object through the join table, and that
has already been saved (if it passed the validation).</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>(<tt>collection</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first
argument, so <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :categories</tt> would add among
others <tt>categories.empty?</tt>.)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>A Developer class declares <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :projects</tt>,
which will add:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects&lt;&lt;</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects.delete</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects=</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#project_ids</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#project_ids=</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects.clear</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects.empty?</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects.size</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects.find(id)</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects.exists?(...)</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects.build</tt> (similar to
<tt>Project.new(&quot;project_id&quot; =&gt; id)</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Developer#projects.create</tt> (similar to <tt>c =
Project.new(&quot;project_id&quot; =&gt; id); c.save; c</tt>)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The declaration may include an options hash to specialize the behavior of
the association.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>:class_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't
be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many
:projects</tt> will by default be linked to the Project class, but if the
real class name is SuperProject, you'll have to specify it with this
option.</p>
</dd><dt>:join_table</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the name of the join table if the default based on lexical order
isn't what you want. <b>WARNING:</b> If you're overwriting the table name
of either class, the <tt>table_name</tt> method MUST be declared underneath
any <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many</tt> declaration in order to work.</p>
</dd><dt>:foreign_key</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is
guessed to be the name of this class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So a
Person class that makes a <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many</tt> association to
Project will use "person_id" as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:association_foreign_key</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the foreign key used for the association on the receiving side of
the association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the
associated class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So if a Person class
makes a <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many</tt> association to Project, the
association will use "project_id" as the default
<tt>:association_foreign_key</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:conditions</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be
included as a <tt>WHERE</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>authorized = 1</tt>.
Record creations from the association are scoped if a hash is used.
<tt>has_many :posts, :conditions =&gt; {:published =&gt; true}</tt> will
create published posts with <tt>@blog.posts.create</tt> or
<tt>@blog.posts.build</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:order</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as an
<tt>ORDER BY</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>last_name, first_name DESC</tt></p>
</dd><dt>:uniq</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, duplicate associated objects will be ignored by accessors and
query methods.</p>
</dd><dt>:finder_sql</dt>
<dd>
<p>Overwrite the default generated SQL statement used to fetch the association
with a manual statement</p>
</dd><dt>:counter_sql</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the size of the association. If
<tt>:finder_sql</tt> is specified but not <tt>:counter_sql</tt>,
<tt>:counter_sql</tt> will be generated by replacing <tt>SELECT ...
FROM</tt> with <tt>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:delete_sql</dt>
<dd>
<p>Overwrite the default generated SQL statement used to remove links between
the associated classes with a manual statement.</p>
</dd><dt>:insert_sql</dt>
<dd>
<p>Overwrite the default generated SQL statement used to add links between the
associated classes with a manual statement.</p>
</dd><dt>:extend</dt>
<dd>
<p>Anonymous module for extending the proxy, see "Association extensions".</p>
</dd><dt>:include</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when the
collection is loaded.</p>
</dd><dt>:group</dt>
<dd>
<p>An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. Uses the <tt>GROUP
BY</tt> SQL-clause.</p>
</dd><dt>:having</dt>
<dd>
<p>Combined with <tt>:group</tt> this can be used to filter the records that a
<tt>GROUP BY</tt> returns. Uses the <tt>HAVING</tt> SQL-clause.</p>
</dd><dt>:limit</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer determining the limit on the number of rows that should be
returned.</p>
</dd><dt>:offset</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer determining the offset from where the rows should be fetched. So
at 5, it would skip the first 4 rows.</p>
</dd><dt>:select</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, this is <tt>*</tt> as in <tt>SELECT * FROM</tt>, but can be
changed if, for example, you want to do a join but not include the joined
columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise
it will raise an error.</p>
</dd><dt>:readonly</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, all the associated objects are readonly through the association.</p>
</dd><dt>:validate</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <tt>false</tt>, don't validate the associated objects when saving the
parent object. <tt>true</tt> by default.</p>
</dd><dt>:autosave</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, always save the associated objects or destroy them if marked for
destruction, when saving the parent object. If false, never save or destroy
the associated objects. By default, only save associated objects that are
new records.</p>
