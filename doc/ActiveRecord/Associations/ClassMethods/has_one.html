<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods#has_one</h1>


<p>Specifies a one-to-one association with another class. This method should
only be used if the other class contains the foreign key. If the current
class contains the foreign key, then you should use <tt>belongs_to</tt>
instead. See also ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on
when to use has_one and when to use belongs_to.</p>

<p>The following methods for retrieval and query of a single associated object
will be added:</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>association(force_reload = false)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the associated object. <tt>nil</tt> is returned if none is found.</p>
</dd><dt>association=(associate)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, sets it as the
foreign key, and saves the associate object.</p>
</dd><dt>build_association(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with
<tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key, but
has not yet been saved.</p>
</dd><dt>create_association(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with
<tt>attributes</tt>, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that
has already been saved (if it passed the validation).</p>
</dd><dt>create_association!(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Does the same as <tt>create_association</tt>, but raises
<tt>ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid</tt> if the record is invalid.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>(<tt>association</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first
argument, so <tt>has_one :manager</tt> would add among others
<tt>manager.nil?</tt>.)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>An Account class declares <tt>has_one :beneficiary</tt>, which will add:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>Account#beneficiary</tt> (similar to <tt>Beneficiary.first(:conditions
=&gt; &quot;account_id = #{id}&quot;)</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Account#beneficiary=(beneficiary)</tt> (similar to
<tt>beneficiary.account_id = account.id; beneficiary.save</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Account#build_beneficiary</tt> (similar to
<tt>Beneficiary.new(&quot;account_id&quot; =&gt; id)</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Account#create_beneficiary</tt> (similar to <tt>b =
Beneficiary.new(&quot;account_id&quot; =&gt; id); b.save; b</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Account#create_beneficiary!</tt> (similar to <tt>b =
Beneficiary.new(&quot;account_id&quot; =&gt; id); b.save!; b</tt>)</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior
of the association.</p>

<p>Options are:</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>:class_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't
be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_one :manager</tt> will by
default be linked to the Manager class, but if the real class name is
Person, you'll have to specify it with this option.</p>
</dd><dt>:conditions</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be
included as a <tt>WHERE</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>rank = 5</tt>.
Record creation from the association is scoped if a hash is used.
<tt>has_one :account, :conditions =&gt; {:enabled =&gt; true}</tt> will
create an enabled account with <tt>@company.create_account</tt> or
<tt>@company.build_account</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:order</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as an
<tt>ORDER BY</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>last_name, first_name
DESC</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:dependent</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set to <tt>:destroy</tt>, the associated object is destroyed when this
object is. If set to <tt>:delete</tt>, the associated object is deleted
<b>without</b> calling its destroy method. If set to <tt>:nullify</tt>, the
associated object's foreign key is set to <tt>NULL</tt>. Also, association
is assigned.</p>
</dd><dt>:foreign_key</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is
guessed to be the name of this class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So a
Person class that makes a <tt>has_one</tt> association will use "person_id"
as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:primary_key</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the method that returns the primary key used for the association.
By default this is <tt>id</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:include</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this
object is loaded.</p>
</dd><dt>:as</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a polymorphic interface (See <tt>belongs_to</tt>).</p>
</dd><dt>:select</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, this is <tt>*</tt> as in <tt>SELECT * FROM</tt>, but can be
changed if, for example, you want to do a join but not include the joined
columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise
it will raise an error.</p>
</dd><dt>:through</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a Join Model through which to perform the query.  Options for
<tt>:class_name</tt>, <tt>:primary_key</tt>, and <tt>:foreign_key</tt> are
ignored, as the association uses the source reflection. You can only use a
<tt>:through</tt> query through a <tt>has_one</tt> or <tt>belongs_to</tt>
association on the join model.</p>
</dd><dt>:source</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the source association name used by <tt>has_one :through</tt>
queries. Only use it if the name cannot be inferred from the association.
<tt>has_one :favorite, :through =&gt; :favorites</tt> will look for a
<tt>:favorite</tt> on Favorite, unless a <tt>:source</tt> is given.</p>
</dd><dt>:source_type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies type of the source association used by <tt>has_one :through</tt>
queries where the source association is a polymorphic <tt>belongs_to</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:readonly</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, the associated object is readonly through the association.</p>
</dd><dt>:validate</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <tt>false</tt>, don't validate the associated object when saving the
parent object. <tt>false</tt> by default.</p>
</dd><dt>:autosave</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, always save the associated object or destroy it if marked for
destruction, when saving the parent object. If false, never save or destroy
the associated object. By default, only save the associated object if it's
a new record.</p>
</dd><dt>:inverse_of</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the <tt>belongs_to</tt> association on the associated
object that is the inverse of this <tt>has_one</tt> association.  Does not
work in combination with <tt>:through</tt> or <tt>:as</tt> options. See
ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on Bi-directional
associations for more detail.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>Option examples:</p>

<pre>has_one :credit_card, :dependent =&gt; :destroy  # destroys the associated credit card
has_one :credit_card, :dependent =&gt; :nullify  # updates the associated records foreign
                                              # key value to NULL rather than destroying it
has_one :last_comment, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Comment&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;posted_on&quot;
has_one :project_manager, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Person&quot;, :conditions =&gt; &quot;role = 'project_manager'&quot;
has_one :attachment, :as =&gt; :attachable
has_one :boss, :readonly =&gt; :true
has_one :club, :through =&gt; :membership
has_one :primary_address, :through =&gt; :addressables, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;addressable.primary = ?&quot;, true], :source =&gt; :addressable</pre>
