<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods#has_many</h1>


<p>Specifies a one-to-many association. The following methods for retrieval
and query of collections of associated objects will be added:</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>collection(force_reload = false)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns an array of all the associated objects. An empty array is returned
if none are found.</p>
</dd><dt>collection&lt;&lt;(object, ...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Adds one or more objects to the collection by setting their foreign keys to
the collection's primary key. Note that this operation instantly fires
update sql without waiting for the save or update call on the parent
object.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.delete(object, ...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes one or more objects from the collection by setting their foreign
keys to <tt>NULL</tt>. Objects will be in addition destroyed if they're
associated with <tt>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</tt>, and deleted if they're
associated with <tt>:dependent =&gt; :delete_all</tt>.</p>

<p>If the <tt>:through</tt> option is used, then the join records are deleted
(rather than nullified) by default, but you can specify <tt>:dependent
=&gt; :destroy</tt> or <tt>:dependent =&gt; :nullify</tt> to override this.</p>
</dd><dt>collection=objects</dt>
<dd>
<p>Replaces the collections content by deleting and adding objects as
appropriate. If the <tt>:through</tt> option is true callbacks in the join
models are triggered except destroy callbacks, since deletion is direct.</p>
</dd><dt>collection_singular_ids</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns an array of the associated objects' ids</p>
</dd><dt>collection_singular_ids=ids</dt>
<dd>
<p>Replace the collection with the objects identified by the primary keys in
<tt>ids</tt>. This method loads the models and calls <tt>collection=</tt>.
See above.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.clear</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes every object from the collection. This destroys the associated
objects if they are associated with <tt>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</tt>,
deletes them directly from the database if <tt>:dependent =&gt;
:delete_all</tt>, otherwise sets their foreign keys to <tt>NULL</tt>. If
the <tt>:through</tt> option is true no destroy callbacks are invoked on
the join models. Join models are directly deleted.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.empty?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns <tt>true</tt> if there are no associated objects.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.size</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the number of associated objects.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.find(...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Finds an associated object according to the same rules as
ActiveRecord::Base.find.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.exists?(...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Checks whether an associated object with the given conditions exists. Uses
the same rules as ActiveRecord::Base.exists?.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.build(attributes = {}, ...)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns one or more new objects of the collection type that have been
instantiated with <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a
foreign key, but have not yet been saved.</p>
</dd><dt>collection.create(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated with
<tt>attributes</tt>, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that
has already been saved (if it passed the validation). <b>Note</b>: This
only works if the base model already exists in the DB, not if it is a new
(unsaved) record!</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>(<b>Note</b>: <tt>collection</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the
first argument, so <tt>has_many :clients</tt> would add among others
<tt>clients.empty?</tt>.)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Example: A Firm class declares <tt>has_many :clients</tt>, which will add:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients</tt> (similar to <tt>Clients.find :all, :conditions =&gt;
[&quot;firm_id = ?&quot;, id]</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients&lt;&lt;</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients.delete</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients=</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#client_ids</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#client_ids=</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients.clear</tt></p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients.empty?</tt> (similar to <tt>firm.clients.size == 0</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients.size</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.count &quot;firm_id =
#{id}&quot;</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients.find</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.find(id, :conditions
=&gt; &quot;firm_id = #{id}&quot;)</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients.exists?(:name =&gt; 'ACME')</tt> (similar to
<tt>Client.exists?(:name =&gt; 'ACME', :firm_id =&gt; firm.id)</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients.build</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.new(&quot;firm_id&quot;
=&gt; id)</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Firm#clients.create</tt> (similar to <tt>c =
Client.new(&quot;firm_id&quot; =&gt; id); c.save; c</tt>)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior
of the association.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>:class_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't
be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_many :products</tt> will
by default be linked to the Product class, but if the real class name is
SpecialProduct, you'll have to specify it with this option.</p>
</dd><dt>:conditions</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the conditions that the associated objects must meet in order to be
included as a <tt>WHERE</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>price &gt; 5 AND
name LIKE 'B%'</tt>.  Record creations from the association are scoped if a
hash is used. <tt>has_many :posts, :conditions =&gt; {:published =&gt;
true}</tt> will create published posts with <tt>@blog.posts.create</tt> or
<tt>@blog.posts.build</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:order</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as an
<tt>ORDER BY</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>last_name, first_name
DESC</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:foreign_key</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is
guessed to be the name of this class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So a
Person class that makes a <tt>has_many</tt> association will use
"person_id" as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:primary_key</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the method that returns the primary key used for the association.
By default this is <tt>id</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:dependent</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set to <tt>:destroy</tt> all the associated objects are destroyed
alongside this object by calling their <tt>destroy</tt> method.  If set to
<tt>:delete_all</tt> all associated objects are deleted <b>without</b>
calling their <tt>destroy</tt> method.  If set to <tt>:nullify</tt> all
associated objects' foreign keys are set to <tt>NULL</tt> <b>without</b>
calling their <tt>save</tt> callbacks. If set to <tt>:restrict</tt> this
object cannot be deleted if it has any associated object.</p>

<p>If using with the <tt>:through</tt> option, the association on the join
model must be a <tt>belongs_to</tt>, and the records which get deleted are
the join records, rather than the associated records.</p>
</dd><dt>:finder_sql</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the association. This is a good
way to go for complex associations that depend on multiple tables. Note:
When this option is used, <tt>find_in_collection</tt> is <em>not</em>
added.</p>
</dd><dt>:counter_sql</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the size of the association. If
<tt>:finder_sql</tt> is specified but not <tt>:counter_sql</tt>,
<tt>:counter_sql</tt> will be generated by replacing <tt>SELECT ...
FROM</tt> with <tt>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:extend</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify a named module for extending the proxy. See "Association
extensions".</p>
</dd><dt>:include</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when the
collection is loaded.</p>
</dd><dt>:group</dt>
<dd>
<p>An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. Uses the <tt>GROUP
BY</tt> SQL-clause.</p>
</dd><dt>:having</dt>
<dd>
<p>Combined with <tt>:group</tt> this can be used to filter the records that a
<tt>GROUP BY</tt> returns. Uses the <tt>HAVING</tt> SQL-clause.</p>
</dd><dt>:limit</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer determining the limit on the number of rows that should be
returned.</p>
</dd><dt>:offset</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer determining the offset from where the rows should be fetched. So
at 5, it would skip the first 4 rows.</p>
</dd><dt>:select</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, this is <tt>*</tt> as in <tt>SELECT * FROM</tt>, but can be
changed if you, for example, want to do a join but not include the joined
columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise
it will raise an error.</p>
</dd><dt>:as</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a polymorphic interface (See <tt>belongs_to</tt>).</p>
</dd><dt>:through</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies an association through which to perform the query. This can be
any other type of association, including other <tt>:through</tt>
associations. Options for <tt>:class_name</tt>, <tt>:primary_key</tt> and
<tt>:foreign_key</tt> are ignored, as the association uses the source
reflection.</p>

<p>If the association on the join model is a <tt>belongs_to</tt>, the
collection can be modified and the records on the <tt>:through</tt> model
will be automatically created and removed as appropriate. Otherwise, the
collection is read-only, so you should manipulate the <tt>:through</tt>
association directly.</p>

<p>If you are going to modify the association (rather than just read from it),
then it is a good idea to set the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option on the source
association on the join model. This allows associated records to be built
which will automatically create the appropriate join model records when
they are saved. (See the 'Association Join Models' section above.)</p>
</dd><dt>:source</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the source association name used by <tt>has_many :through</tt>
queries. Only use it if the name cannot be inferred from the association.
<tt>has_many :subscribers, :through =&gt; :subscriptions</tt> will look for
either <tt>:subscribers</tt> or <tt>:subscriber</tt> on Subscription,
unless a <tt>:source</tt> is given.</p>
</dd><dt>:source_type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies type of the source association used by <tt>has_many :through</tt>
queries where the source association is a polymorphic <tt>belongs_to</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:uniq</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, duplicates will be omitted from the collection. Useful in
conjunction with <tt>:through</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:readonly</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, all the associated objects are readonly through the association.</p>
</dd><dt>:validate</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <tt>false</tt>, don't validate the associated objects when saving the
parent object. true by default.</p>
</dd><dt>:autosave</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, always save the associated objects or destroy them if marked for
destruction, when saving the parent object. If false, never save or destroy
the associated objects. By default, only save associated objects that are
new records.</p>
</dd><dt>:inverse_of</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the <tt>belongs_to</tt> association on the associated
object that is the inverse of this <tt>has_many</tt> association. Does not
work in combination with <tt>:through</tt> or <tt>:as</tt> options. See
ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on Bi-directional
associations for more detail.</p>
