<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods#belongs_to</h1>


<p>Specifies a one-to-one association with another class. This method should
only be used if this class contains the foreign key. If the other class
contains the foreign key, then you should use <tt>has_one</tt> instead. See
also ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on when to use
<tt>has_one</tt> and when to use <tt>belongs_to</tt>.</p>

<p>Methods will be added for retrieval and query for a single associated
object, for which this object holds an id:</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>association(force_reload = false)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the associated object. <tt>nil</tt> is returned if none is found.</p>
</dd><dt>association=(associate)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, and sets it as the
foreign key.</p>
</dd><dt>build_association(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with
<tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key, but
has not yet been saved.</p>
</dd><dt>create_association(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with
<tt>attributes</tt>, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that
has already been saved (if it passed the validation).</p>
</dd><dt>create_association!(attributes = {})</dt>
<dd>
<p>Does the same as <tt>create_association</tt>, but raises
<tt>ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid</tt> if the record is invalid.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>(<tt>association</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first
argument, so <tt>belongs_to :author</tt> would add among others
<tt>author.nil?</tt>.)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>A Post class declares <tt>belongs_to :author</tt>, which will add:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>Post#author</tt> (similar to <tt>Author.find(author_id)</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Post#author=(author)</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author_id =
author.id</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Post#build_author</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Post#create_author</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new;
post.author.save; post.author</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Post#create_author!</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new;
post.author.save!; post.author</tt>)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior
of the association.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>:class_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't
be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_one :author</tt> will by
default be linked to the Author class, but if the real class name is
Person, you'll have to specify it with this option.</p>
</dd><dt>:conditions</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be
included as a <tt>WHERE</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>authorized = 1</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:select</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, this is <tt>*</tt> as in <tt>SELECT * FROM</tt>, but can be
changed if, for example, you want to do a join but not include the joined
columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise
it will raise an error.</p>
</dd><dt>:foreign_key</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is
guessed to be the name of the association with an "_id" suffix. So a class
that defines a <tt>belongs_to :person</tt> association will use "person_id"
as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>. Similarly, <tt>belongs_to
:favorite_person, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Person&quot;</tt> will use a
foreign key of "favorite_person_id".</p>
</dd><dt>:foreign_type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the column used to store the associated object's type, if this is a
polymorphic association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the
association with a "_type" suffix. So a class that defines a <tt>belongs_to
:taggable, :polymorphic =&gt; true</tt> association will use
"taggable_type" as the default <tt>:foreign_type</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:primary_key</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the method that returns the primary key of associated object used
for the association. By default this is id.</p>
</dd><dt>:dependent</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set to <tt>:destroy</tt>, the associated object is destroyed when this
object is. If set to <tt>:delete</tt>, the associated object is deleted
<b>without</b> calling its destroy method. This option should not be
specified when <tt>belongs_to</tt> is used in conjunction with a
<tt>has_many</tt> relationship on another class because of the potential to
leave orphaned records behind.</p>
</dd><dt>:counter_cache</dt>
<dd>
<p>Caches the number of belonging objects on the associate class through the
use of <tt>increment_counter</tt> and <tt>decrement_counter</tt>. The
counter cache is incremented when an object of this class is created and
decremented when it's destroyed. This requires that a column named
<tt>#{table_name}_count</tt> (such as <tt>comments_count</tt> for a
belonging Comment class) is used on the associate class (such as a Post
class). You can also specify a custom counter cache column by providing a
column name instead of a <tt>true</tt>/<tt>false</tt> value to this option
(e.g., <tt>:counter_cache =&gt; :my_custom_counter</tt>.) Note: Specifying
a counter cache will add it to that model's list of readonly attributes
using <tt>attr_readonly</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:include</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this
object is loaded.</p>
</dd><dt>:polymorphic</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify this association is a polymorphic association by passing
<tt>true</tt>. Note: If you've enabled the counter cache, then you may want
to add the counter cache attribute to the <tt>attr_readonly</tt> list in
the associated classes (e.g. <tt>class Post; attr_readonly :comments_count;
end</tt>).</p>
</dd><dt>:readonly</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, the associated object is readonly through the association.</p>
</dd><dt>:validate</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <tt>false</tt>, don't validate the associated objects when saving the
parent object. <tt>false</tt> by default.</p>
</dd><dt>:autosave</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, always save the associated object or destroy it if marked for
destruction, when saving the parent object. If false, never save or destroy
the associated object. By default, only save the associated object if it's
a new record.</p>
</dd><dt>:touch</dt>
<dd>
<p>If true, the associated object will be touched (the updated_at/on
attributes set to now) when this record is either saved or destroyed. If
you specify a symbol, that attribute will be updated with the current time
in addition to the updated_at/on attribute.</p>
</dd><dt>:inverse_of</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the <tt>has_one</tt> or <tt>has_many</tt> association
on the associated object that is the inverse of this <tt>belongs_to</tt>
association.  Does not work in combination with the <tt>:polymorphic</tt>
options. See ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on
Bi-directional associations for more detail.</p>
