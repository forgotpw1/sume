<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods#belongs_to</h1>

Specifies a one-to-one association with another class. This method should only be used
if this class contains the foreign key. If the other class contains the foreign key,
then you should use +has_one+ instead. See also ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview
on when to use +has_one+ and when to use +belongs_to+.

Methods will be added for retrieval and query for a single associated object, for which
this object holds an id:

[association(force_reload = false)]
  Returns the associated object. +nil+ is returned if none is found.
[association=(associate)]
  Assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, and sets it as the foreign key.
[build_association(attributes = {})]
  Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated
  with +attributes+ and linked to this object through a foreign key, but has not yet been saved.
[create_association(attributes = {})]
  Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated
  with +attributes+, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that
  has already been saved (if it passed the validation).
[create_association!(attributes = {})]
  Does the same as <tt>create_association</tt>, but raises <tt>ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid</tt>
  if the record is invalid.

(+association+ is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so
<tt>belongs_to :author</tt> would add among others <tt>author.nil?</tt>.)

=== Example

A Post class declares <tt>belongs_to :author</tt>, which will add:
* <tt>Post#author</tt> (similar to <tt>Author.find(author_id)</tt>)
* <tt>Post#author=(author)</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author_id = author.id</tt>)
* <tt>Post#build_author</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new</tt>)
* <tt>Post#create_author</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new; post.author.save; post.author</tt>)
* <tt>Post#create_author!</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new; post.author.save!; post.author</tt>)
The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.

=== Options

[:class_name]
  Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
  from the association name. So <tt>belongs_to :author</tt> will by default be linked to the Author class, but
  if the real class name is Person, you'll have to specify it with this option.
[:conditions]
  Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be included as a +WHERE+
  SQL fragment, such as <tt>authorized = 1</tt>.
[:select]
  By default, this is <tt>*</tt> as in <tt>SELECT * FROM</tt>, but can be changed
  if you want to do a join but not include the joined columns, for example. Do not
  forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise it will raise an error.
[:foreign_key]
  Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
  of the association with an "_id" suffix. So a class that defines a <tt>belongs_to :person</tt>
  association will use "person_id" as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>. Similarly,
  <tt>belongs_to :favorite_person, :class_name => "Person"</tt> will use a foreign key
  of "favorite_person_id".
[:foreign_type]
  Specify the column used to store the associated object's type, if this is a polymorphic
  association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the association with a "_type"
  suffix. So a class that defines a <tt>belongs_to :taggable, :polymorphic => true</tt>
  association will use "taggable_type" as the default <tt>:foreign_type</tt>.
[:primary_key]
  Specify the method that returns the primary key of associated object used for the association.
  By default this is id.
[:dependent]
  If set to <tt>:destroy</tt>, the associated object is destroyed when this object is. If set to
  <tt>:delete</tt>, the associated object is deleted *without* calling its destroy method.
  This option should not be specified when <tt>belongs_to</tt> is used in conjunction with
  a <tt>has_many</tt> relationship on another class because of the potential to leave
  orphaned records behind.
[:counter_cache]
  Caches the number of belonging objects on the associate class through the use of +increment_counter+
  and +decrement_counter+. The counter cache is incremented when an object of this
  class is created and decremented when it's destroyed. This requires that a column
  named <tt>#{table_name}_count</tt> (such as +comments_count+ for a belonging Comment class)
  is used on the associate class (such as a Post class) - that is the migration for
  <tt>#{table_name}_count</tt> is created on the associate class (such that Post.comments_count will
  return the count cached, see note below). You can also specify a custom counter
  cache column by providing a column name instead of a +true+/+false+ value to this
  option (e.g., <tt>:counter_cache => :my_custom_counter</tt>.)
  Note: Specifying a counter cache will add it to that model's list of readonly attributes
  using +attr_readonly+.
[:include]
  Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this object is loaded.
[:polymorphic]
  Specify this association is a polymorphic association by passing +true+.
  Note: If you've enabled the counter cache, then you may want to add the counter cache attribute
  to the +attr_readonly+ list in the associated classes (e.g. <tt>class Post; attr_readonly :comments_count; end</tt>).
[:readonly]
  If true, the associated object is readonly through the association.
[:validate]
  If +false+, don't validate the associated objects when saving the parent object. +false+ by default.
[:autosave]
  If true, always save the associated object or destroy it if marked for destruction, when
  saving the parent object.
  If false, never save or destroy the associated object.
  By default, only save the associated object if it's a new record.
[:touch]
  If true, the associated object will be touched (the updated_at/on attributes set to now)
  when this record is either saved or destroyed. If you specify a symbol, that attribute
  will be updated with the current time in addition to the updated_at/on attribute.
[:inverse_of]
  Specifies the name of the <tt>has_one</tt> or <tt>has_many</tt> association on the associated
  object that is the inverse of this <tt>belongs_to</tt> association. Does not work in
  combination with the <tt>:polymorphic</tt> options.
  See ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on Bi-directional associations for more detail.

Option examples:
  belongs_to :firm, :foreign_key => "client_of"
  belongs_to :person, :primary_key => "name", :foreign_key => "person_name"
  belongs_to :author, :class_name => "Person", :foreign_key => "author_id"
  belongs_to :valid_coupon, :class_name => "Coupon", :foreign_key => "coupon_id",
             :conditions => 'discounts > #{payments_count}'
  belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic => true
  belongs_to :project, :readonly => true
  belongs_to :post, :counter_cache => true
  belongs_to :company, :touch => true
  belongs_to :company, :touch => :employees_last_updated_at
