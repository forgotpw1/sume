<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#empty?</h1>

Returns true if the collection is empty. Equivalent to
<tt>collection.size.zero?</tt>. If the collection has not been already
loaded and you are going to fetch the records anyway it is better to
check <tt>collection.length.zero?</tt>.
