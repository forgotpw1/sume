<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#length</h1>

Returns the size of the collection calling +size+ on the target.

If the collection has been already loaded +length+ and +size+ are
equivalent. If not and you are going to need the records anyway this
method will take one less query. Otherwise +size+ is more efficient.
