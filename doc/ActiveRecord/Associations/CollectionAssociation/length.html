<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#length</h1>


<p>Returns the size of the collection calling <tt>size</tt> on the target.</p>

<p>If the collection has been already loaded <tt>length</tt> and <tt>size</tt>
are equivalent. If not and you are going to need the records anyway this
method will take one less query. Otherwise <tt>size</tt> is more efficient.</p>
