<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#size</h1>

Returns the size of the collection by executing a SELECT COUNT(*)
query if the collection hasn't been loaded, and calling
<tt>collection.size</tt> if it has.

If the collection has been already loaded +size+ and +length+ are
equivalent. If not and you are going to need the records anyway
+length+ will take one less query. Otherwise +size+ is more efficient.

This method is abstract in the sense that it relies on
+count_records+, which is a method descendants have to provide.
