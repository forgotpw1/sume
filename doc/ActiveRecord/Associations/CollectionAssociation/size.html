<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#size</h1>


<p>Returns the size of the collection by executing a SELECT COUNT(*) query if
the collection hasn't been loaded, and calling <tt>collection.size</tt> if
it has.</p>

<p>If the collection has been already loaded <tt>size</tt> and <tt>length</tt>
are equivalent. If not and you are going to need the records anyway
<tt>length</tt> will take one less query. Otherwise <tt>size</tt> is more
efficient.</p>

<p>This method is abstract in the sense that it relies on
<tt>count_records</tt>, which is a method descendants have to provide.</p>
