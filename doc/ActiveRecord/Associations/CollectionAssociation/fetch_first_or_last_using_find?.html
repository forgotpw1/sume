<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#fetch_first_or_last_using_find?</h1>

Should we deal with assoc.first or assoc.last by issuing an independent query to
the database, or by getting the target, and then taking the first/last item from that?

If the args is just a non-empty options hash, go to the database.

Otherwise, go to the database only if none of the following are true:
  * target already loaded
  * owner is new record
  * custom :finder_sql exists
  * target contains new or changed record(s)
  * the first arg is an integer (which indicates the number of records to be returned)
