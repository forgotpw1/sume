<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#delete</h1>


<p>Removes <tt>records</tt> from this association calling
<tt>before_remove</tt> and <tt>after_remove</tt> callbacks.</p>

<p>This method is abstract in the sense that <tt>delete_records</tt> has to be
provided by descendants. Note this method does not imply the records are
actually removed from the database, that depends precisely on
<tt>delete_records</tt>. They are in any case removed from the collection.</p>
