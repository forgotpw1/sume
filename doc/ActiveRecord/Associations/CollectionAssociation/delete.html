<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#delete</h1>

Removes +records+ from this association calling +before_remove+ and
+after_remove+ callbacks.

This method is abstract in the sense that +delete_records+ has to be
provided by descendants. Note this method does not imply the records
are actually removed from the database, that depends precisely on
+delete_records+. They are in any case removed from the collection.
