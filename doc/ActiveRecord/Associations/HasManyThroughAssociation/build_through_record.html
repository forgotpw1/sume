<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::HasManyThroughAssociation#build_through_record</h1>

We temporarily cache through record that has been build, because if we build a
through record in build_record and then subsequently call insert_record, then we
want to use the exact same object.

However, after insert_record has been called, we clear the cache entry because
we want it to be possible to have multiple instances of the same record in an
association
