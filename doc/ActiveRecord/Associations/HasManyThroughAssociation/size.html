<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::HasManyThroughAssociation#size</h1>


<p>Returns the size of the collection by executing a SELECT COUNT(*) query if
the collection hasn't been loaded and calling collection.size if it has. If
it's more likely than not that the collection does have a size larger than
zero, and you need to fetch that collection afterwards, it'll take one
fewer SELECT query if you use #length.</p>
