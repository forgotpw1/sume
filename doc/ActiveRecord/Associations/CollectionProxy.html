Association proxies in Active Record are middlemen between the object that
holds the association, known as the <tt>@owner</tt>, and the actual associated
object, known as the <tt>@target</tt>. The kind of association any proxy is
about is available in <tt>@reflection</tt>. That's an instance of the class
ActiveRecord::Reflection::AssociationReflection.

For example, given

  class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
  end

  blog = Blog.first

the association proxy in <tt>blog.posts</tt> has the object in +blog+ as
<tt>@owner</tt>, the collection of its posts as <tt>@target</tt>, and
the <tt>@reflection</tt> object represents a <tt>:has_many</tt> macro.

This class has most of the basic instance methods removed, and delegates
unknown methods to <tt>@target</tt> via <tt>method_missing</tt>. As a
corner case, it even removes the +class+ method and that's why you get

  blog.posts.class # => Array

though the object behind <tt>blog.posts</tt> is not an Array, but an
ActiveRecord::Associations::HasManyAssociation.

The <tt>@target</tt> object is not \loaded until needed. For example,

  blog.posts.count

is computed directly through SQL and does not trigger by itself the
instantiation of the actual post records.
