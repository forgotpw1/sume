= Active Record Association Collection

CollectionAssociation is an abstract class that provides common stuff to
ease the implementation of association proxies that represent
collections. See the class hierarchy in AssociationProxy.

You need to be careful with assumptions regarding the target: The proxy
does not fetch records from the database until it needs them, but new
ones created with +build+ are added to the target. So, the target may be
non-empty and still lack children waiting to be read from the database.
If you look directly to the database you cannot assume that's the entire
collection because new records may have been added to the target, etc.

If you need to work on all current children, new and existing records,
+load_target+ and the +loaded+ flag are your friends.
