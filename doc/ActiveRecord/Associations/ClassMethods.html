Associations are a set of macro-like class methods for tying objects together through
foreign keys. They express relationships like "Project has one Project Manager"
or "Project belongs to a Portfolio". Each macro adds a number of methods to the
class which are specialized according to the collection or association symbol and the
options hash. It works much the same way as Ruby's own <tt>attr*</tt>
methods.

  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to              :portfolio
    has_one                 :project_manager
    has_many                :milestones
    has_and_belongs_to_many :categories
  end

The project class now has the following methods (and more) to ease the traversal and
manipulation of its relationships:
* <tt>Project#portfolio, Project#portfolio=(portfolio), Project#portfolio.nil?</tt>
* <tt>Project#project_manager, Project#project_manager=(project_manager), Project#project_manager.nil?,</tt>
* <tt>Project#milestones.empty?, Project#milestones.size, Project#milestones, Project#milestones<<(milestone),</tt>
  <tt>Project#milestones.delete(milestone), Project#milestones.find(milestone_id), Project#milestones.find(:all, options),</tt>
  <tt>Project#milestones.build, Project#milestones.create</tt>
* <tt>Project#categories.empty?, Project#categories.size, Project#categories, Project#categories<<(category1),</tt>
  <tt>Project#categories.delete(category1)</tt>

=== A word of warning

Don't create associations that have the same name as instance methods of
<tt>ActiveRecord::Base</tt>. Since the association adds a method with that name to
its model, it will override the inherited method and break things.
For instance, +attributes+ and +connection+ would be bad choices for association names.

== Cardinality and associations

Active Record associations can be used to describe one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many
relationships between models. Each model uses an association to describe its role in
the relation. The +belongs_to+ association is always used in the model that has
the foreign key.

=== One-to-one

Use +has_one+ in the base, and +belongs_to+ in the associated model.

  class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :office
  end
  class Office < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :employee    # foreign key - employee_id
  end

=== One-to-many

Use +has_many+ in the base, and +belongs_to+ in the associated model.

  class Manager < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :employees
  end
  class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :manager     # foreign key - manager_id
  end

=== Many-to-many

There are two ways to build a many-to-many relationship.

The first way uses a +has_many+ association with the <tt>:through</tt> option and a join model, so
there are two stages of associations.

  class Assignment < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :programmer  # foreign key - programmer_id
    belongs_to :project     # foreign key - project_id
  end
  class Programmer < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :assignments
    has_many :projects, :through => :assignments
  end
  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :assignments
    has_many :programmers, :through => :assignments
  end

For the second way, use +has_and_belongs_to_many+ in both models. This requires a join table
that has no corresponding model or primary key.

  class Programmer < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_and_belongs_to_many :projects       # foreign keys in the join table
  end
  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_and_belongs_to_many :programmers    # foreign keys in the join table
  end

Choosing which way to build a many-to-many relationship is not always simple.
If you need to work with the relationship model as its own entity,
use <tt>has_many :through</tt>. Use +has_and_belongs_to_many+ when working with legacy schemas or when
you never work directly with the relationship itself.

== Is it a +belongs_to+ or +has_one+ association?

Both express a 1-1 relationship. The difference is mostly where to place the foreign
key, which goes on the table for the class declaring the +belongs_to+ relationship.

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    # I reference an account.
    belongs_to :account
  end

  class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    # One user references me.
    has_one :user
  end

The tables for these classes could look something like:

  CREATE TABLE users (
    id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
    account_id int(11) default NULL,
    name varchar default NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY  (id)
  )

  CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
    name varchar default NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY  (id)
  )

== Unsaved objects and associations

You can manipulate objects and associations before they are saved to the database, but
there is some special behavior you should be aware of, mostly involving the saving of
associated objects.

You can set the :autosave option on a <tt>has_one</tt>, <tt>belongs_to</tt>,
<tt>has_many</tt>, or <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many</tt> association. Setting it
to +true+ will _always_ save the members, whereas setting it to +false+ will
_never_ save the members. More details about :autosave option is available at
autosave_association.rb .

=== One-to-one associations

* Assigning an object to a +has_one+ association automatically saves that object and
  the object being replaced (if there is one), in order to update their foreign
  keys - except if the parent object is unsaved (<tt>new_record? == true</tt>).
* If either of these saves fail (due to one of the objects being invalid), an
  <tt>ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved</tt> exception is raised and the assignment is
  cancelled.
* If you wish to assign an object to a +has_one+ association without saving it,
  use the <tt>build_association</tt> method (documented below). The object being
  replaced will still be saved to update its foreign key.
* Assigning an object to a +belongs_to+ association does not save the object, since
  the foreign key field belongs on the parent. It does not save the parent either.

=== Collections

* Adding an object to a collection (+has_many+ or +has_and_belongs_to_many+) automatically
  saves that object, except if the parent object (the owner of the collection) is not yet
  stored in the database.
* If saving any of the objects being added to a collection (via <tt>push</tt> or similar)
  fails, then <tt>push</tt> returns +false+.
* If saving fails while replacing the collection (via <tt>association=</tt>), an
  <tt>ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved</tt> exception is raised and the assignment is
  cancelled.
* You can add an object to a collection without automatically saving it by using the
  <tt>collection.build</tt> method (documented below).
* All unsaved (<tt>new_record? == true</tt>) members of the collection are automatically
  saved when the parent is saved.

=== Association callbacks

Similar to the normal callbacks that hook into the life cycle of an Active Record object,
you can also define callbacks that get triggered when you add an object to or remove an
object from an association collection.

  class Project
    has_and_belongs_to_many :developers, :after_add => :evaluate_velocity

    def evaluate_velocity(developer)
      ...
    end
  end

It's possible to stack callbacks by passing them as an array. Example:

  class Project
    has_and_belongs_to_many :developers,
                            :after_add => [:evaluate_velocity, Proc.new { |p, d| p.shipping_date = Time.now}]
  end

Possible callbacks are: +before_add+, +after_add+, +before_remove+ and +after_remove+.

Should any of the +before_add+ callbacks throw an exception, the object does not get
added to the collection. Same with the +before_remove+ callbacks; if an exception is
thrown the object doesn't get removed.

=== Association extensions

The proxy objects that control the access to associations can be extended through anonymous
modules. This is especially beneficial for adding new finders, creators, and other
factory-type methods that are only used as part of this association.

  class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :people do
      def find_or_create_by_name(name)
        first_name, last_name = name.split(" ", 2)
        find_or_create_by_first_name_and_last_name(first_name, last_name)
      end
    end
  end

  person = Account.first.people.find_or_create_by_name("David Heinemeier Hansson")
  person.first_name # => "David"
  person.last_name  # => "Heinemeier Hansson"

If you need to share the same extensions between many associations, you can use a named
extension module.

  module FindOrCreateByNameExtension
    def find_or_create_by_name(name)
      first_name, last_name = name.split(" ", 2)
      find_or_create_by_first_name_and_last_name(first_name, last_name)
    end
  end

  class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :people, :extend => FindOrCreateByNameExtension
  end

  class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :people, :extend => FindOrCreateByNameExtension
  end

If you need to use multiple named extension modules, you can specify an array of modules
with the <tt>:extend</tt> option.
In the case of name conflicts between methods in the modules, methods in modules later
in the array supercede those earlier in the array.

  class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :people, :extend => [FindOrCreateByNameExtension, FindRecentExtension]
  end

Some extensions can only be made to work with knowledge of the association's internals.
Extensions can access relevant state using the following methods (where +items+ is the
name of the association):

* <tt>record.association(:items).owner</tt> - Returns the object the association is part of.
* <tt>record.association(:items).reflection</tt> - Returns the reflection object that describes the association.
* <tt>record.association(:items).target</tt> - Returns the associated object for +belongs_to+ and +has_one+, or
  the collection of associated objects for +has_many+ and +has_and_belongs_to_many+.

However, inside the actual extension code, you will not have access to the <tt>record</tt> as
above. In this case, you can access <tt>proxy_association</tt>. For example,
<tt>record.association(:items)</tt> and <tt>record.items.proxy_association</tt> will return
the same object, allowing you to make calls like <tt>proxy_association.owner</tt> inside
association extensions.

=== Association Join Models

Has Many associations can be configured with the <tt>:through</tt> option to use an
explicit join model to retrieve the data.  This operates similarly to a
+has_and_belongs_to_many+ association.  The advantage is that you're able to add validations,
callbacks, and extra attributes on the join model.  Consider the following schema:

  class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :authorships
    has_many :books, :through => :authorships
  end

  class Authorship < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author
    belongs_to :book
  end

  @author = Author.first
  @author.authorships.collect { |a| a.book } # selects all books that the author's authorships belong to
  @author.books                              # selects all books by using the Authorship join model

You can also go through a +has_many+ association on the join model:

  class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many   :clients
    has_many   :invoices, :through => :clients
  end

  class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :firm
    has_many   :invoices
  end

  class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :client
  end

  @firm = Firm.first
  @firm.clients.collect { |c| c.invoices }.flatten # select all invoices for all clients of the firm
  @firm.invoices                                   # selects all invoices by going through the Client join model

Similarly you can go through a +has_one+ association on the join model:

  class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many   :users
    has_many   :avatars, :through => :users
  end

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :group
    has_one    :avatar
  end

  class Avatar < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :user
  end

  @group = Group.first
  @group.users.collect { |u| u.avatar }.flatten # select all avatars for all users in the group
  @group.avatars                                # selects all avatars by going through the User join model.

An important caveat with going through +has_one+ or +has_many+ associations on the
join model is that these associations are *read-only*.  For example, the following
would not work following the previous example:

  @group.avatars << Avatar.new   # this would work if User belonged_to Avatar rather than the other way around
  @group.avatars.delete(@group.avatars.last)  # so would this

If you are using a +belongs_to+ on the join model, it is a good idea to set the
<tt>:inverse_of</tt> option on the +belongs_to+, which will mean that the following example
works correctly (where <tt>tags</tt> is a +has_many+ <tt>:through</tt> association):

  @post = Post.first
  @tag = @post.tags.build :name => "ruby"
  @tag.save

The last line ought to save the through record (a <tt>Taggable</tt>). This will only work if the
<tt>:inverse_of</tt> is set:

  class Taggable < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :post
    belongs_to :tag, :inverse_of => :taggings
  end

=== Nested Associations

You can actually specify *any* association with the <tt>:through</tt> option, including an
association which has a <tt>:through</tt> option itself. For example:

  class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
    has_many :comments, :through => :posts
    has_many :commenters, :through => :comments
  end

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :comments
  end

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :commenter
  end

  @author = Author.first
  @author.commenters # => People who commented on posts written by the author

An equivalent way of setting up this association this would be:

  class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
    has_many :commenters, :through => :posts
  end

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :comments
    has_many :commenters, :through => :comments
  end

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :commenter
  end

When using nested association, you will not be able to modify the association because there
is not enough information to know what modification to make. For example, if you tried to
add a <tt>Commenter</tt> in the example above, there would be no way to tell how to set up the
intermediate <tt>Post</tt> and <tt>Comment</tt> objects.

=== Polymorphic Associations

Polymorphic associations on models are not restricted on what types of models they
can be associated with.  Rather, they specify an interface that a +has_many+ association
must adhere to.

  class Asset < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic => true
  end

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :assets, :as => :attachable         # The :as option specifies the polymorphic interface to use.
  end

  @asset.attachable = @post

This works by using a type column in addition to a foreign key to specify the associated
record.  In the Asset example, you'd need an +attachable_id+ integer column and an
+attachable_type+ string column.

Using polymorphic associations in combination with single table inheritance (STI) is
a little tricky. In order for the associations to work as expected, ensure that you
store the base model for the STI models in the type column of the polymorphic
association. To continue with the asset example above, suppose there are guest posts
and member posts that use the posts table for STI. In this case, there must be a +type+
column in the posts table.

  class Asset < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic => true

    def attachable_type=(sType)
       super(sType.to_s.classify.constantize.base_class.to_s)
    end
  end

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    # because we store "Post" in attachable_type now :dependent => :destroy will work
    has_many :assets, :as => :attachable, :dependent => :destroy
  end

  class GuestPost < Post
  end

  class MemberPost < Post
  end

== Caching

All of the methods are built on a simple caching principle that will keep the result
of the last query around unless specifically instructed not to. The cache is even
shared across methods to make it even cheaper to use the macro-added methods without
worrying too much about performance at the first go.

  project.milestones             # fetches milestones from the database
  project.milestones.size        # uses the milestone cache
  project.milestones.empty?      # uses the milestone cache
  project.milestones(true).size  # fetches milestones from the database
  project.milestones             # uses the milestone cache

== Eager loading of associations

Eager loading is a way to find objects of a certain class and a number of named associations.
This is one of the easiest ways of to prevent the dreaded 1+N problem in which fetching 100
posts that each need to display their author triggers 101 database queries. Through the
use of eager loading, the 101 queries can be reduced to 2.

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author
    has_many   :comments
  end

Consider the following loop using the class above:

  for post in Post.all
    puts "Post:            " + post.title
    puts "Written by:      " + post.author.name
    puts "Last comment on: " + post.comments.first.created_on
  end

To iterate over these one hundred posts, we'll generate 201 database queries. Let's
first just optimize it for retrieving the author:

  for post in Post.find(:all, :include => :author)

This references the name of the +belongs_to+ association that also used the <tt>:author</tt>
symbol. After loading the posts, find will collect the +author_id+ from each one and load
all the referenced authors with one query. Doing so will cut down the number of queries
from 201 to 102.

We can improve upon the situation further by referencing both associations in the finder with:

  for post in Post.find(:all, :include => [ :author, :comments ])

This will load all comments with a single query. This reduces the total number of queries
to 3. More generally the number of queries will be 1 plus the number of associations
named (except if some of the associations are polymorphic +belongs_to+ - see below).

To include a deep hierarchy of associations, use a hash:

  for post in Post.find(:all, :include => [ :author, { :comments => { :author => :gravatar } } ])

That'll grab not only all the comments but all their authors and gravatar pictures.
You can mix and match symbols, arrays and hashes in any combination to describe the
associations you want to load.

All of this power shouldn't fool you into thinking that you can pull out huge amounts
of data with no performance penalty just because you've reduced the number of queries.
The database still needs to send all the data to Active Record and it still needs to
be processed. So it's no catch-all for performance problems, but it's a great way to
cut down on the number of queries in a situation as the one described above.

Since only one table is loaded at a time, conditions or orders cannot reference tables
other than the main one. If this is the case Active Record falls back to the previously
used LEFT OUTER JOIN based strategy. For example

  Post.includes([:author, :comments]).where(['comments.approved = ?', true]).all

This will result in a single SQL query with joins along the lines of:
<tt>LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id</tt> and
<tt>LEFT OUTER JOIN authors ON authors.id = posts.author_id</tt>. Note that using conditions
like this can have unintended consequences.
In the above example posts with no approved comments are not returned at all, because
the conditions apply to the SQL statement as a whole and not just to the association.
You must disambiguate column references for this fallback to happen, for example
<tt>:order => "author.name DESC"</tt> will work but <tt>:order => "name DESC"</tt> will not.

If you do want eager load only some members of an association it is usually more natural
to <tt>:include</tt> an association which has conditions defined on it:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :approved_comments, :class_name => 'Comment', :conditions => ['approved = ?', true]
  end

  Post.find(:all, :include => :approved_comments)

This will load posts and eager load the +approved_comments+ association, which contains
only those comments that have been approved.

If you eager load an association with a specified <tt>:limit</tt> option, it will be ignored,
returning all the associated objects:

  class Picture < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :most_recent_comments, :class_name => 'Comment', :order => 'id DESC', :limit => 10
  end

  Picture.first(:include => :most_recent_comments).most_recent_comments # => returns all associated comments.

When eager loaded, conditions are interpolated in the context of the model class, not
the model instance.  Conditions are lazily interpolated before the actual model exists.

Eager loading is supported with polymorphic associations.

  class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :addressable, :polymorphic => true
  end

A call that tries to eager load the addressable model

  Address.find(:all, :include => :addressable)

This will execute one query to load the addresses and load the addressables with one
query per addressable type.
For example if all the addressables are either of class Person or Company then a total
of 3 queries will be executed. The list of addressable types to load is determined on
the back of the addresses loaded. This is not supported if Active Record has to fallback
to the previous implementation of eager loading and will raise ActiveRecord::EagerLoadPolymorphicError.
The reason is that the parent model's type is a column value so its corresponding table
name cannot be put in the +FROM+/+JOIN+ clauses of that query.

== Table Aliasing

Active Record uses table aliasing in the case that a table is referenced multiple times
in a join.  If a table is referenced only once, the standard table name is used.  The
second time, the table is aliased as <tt>#{reflection_name}_#{parent_table_name}</tt>.
Indexes are appended for any more successive uses of the table name.

  Post.find :all, :joins => :comments
  # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ...
  Post.find :all, :joins => :special_comments # STI
  # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ... AND comments.type = 'SpecialComment'
  Post.find :all, :joins => [:comments, :special_comments] # special_comments is the reflection name, posts is the parent table name
  # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ... INNER JOIN comments special_comments_posts

Acts as tree example:

  TreeMixin.find :all, :joins => :children
  # => SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
  TreeMixin.find :all, :joins => => :parent
  # => SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
                              INNER JOIN parents_mixins ...
  TreeMixin.find :all, :joins => => {:parent => :children}
  # => SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
                              INNER JOIN parents_mixins ...
                              INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins_2

Has and Belongs to Many join tables use the same idea, but add a <tt>_join</tt> suffix:

  Post.find :all, :joins => :categories
  # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
  Post.find :all, :joins => => :posts
  # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
                             INNER JOIN categories_posts posts_categories_join INNER JOIN posts posts_categories
  Post.find :all, :joins => => {:posts => :categories}
  # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
                             INNER JOIN categories_posts posts_categories_join INNER JOIN posts posts_categories
                             INNER JOIN categories_posts categories_posts_join INNER JOIN categories categories_posts_2

If you wish to specify your own custom joins using a <tt>:joins</tt> option, those table
names will take precedence over the eager associations:

  Post.find :all, :joins => :comments, :joins => "inner join comments ..."
  # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments_posts ON ... INNER JOIN comments ...
  Post.find :all, :joins => [:comments, :special_comments], :joins => "inner join comments ..."
  # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments comments_posts ON ...
                             INNER JOIN comments special_comments_posts ...
                             INNER JOIN comments ...

Table aliases are automatically truncated according to the maximum length of table identifiers
according to the specific database.

== Modules

By default, associations will look for objects within the current module scope. Consider:

  module MyApplication
    module Business
      class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base
         has_many :clients
       end

      class Client < ActiveRecord::Base; end
    end
  end

When <tt>Firm#clients</tt> is called, it will in turn call
<tt>MyApplication::Business::Client.find_all_by_firm_id(firm.id)</tt>.
If you want to associate with a class in another module scope, this can be done by
specifying the complete class name.

  module MyApplication
    module Business
      class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base; end
    end

    module Billing
      class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :firm, :class_name => "MyApplication::Business::Firm"
      end
    end
  end

== Bi-directional associations

When you specify an association there is usually an association on the associated model
that specifies the same relationship in reverse.  For example, with the following models:

   class Dungeon < ActiveRecord::Base
     has_many :traps
     has_one :evil_wizard
   end

   class Trap < ActiveRecord::Base
     belongs_to :dungeon
   end

   class EvilWizard < ActiveRecord::Base
     belongs_to :dungeon
   end

The +traps+ association on +Dungeon+ and the +dungeon+ association on +Trap+ are
the inverse of each other and the inverse of the +dungeon+ association on +EvilWizard+
is the +evil_wizard+ association on +Dungeon+ (and vice-versa).  By default,
Active Record doesn't know anything about these inverse relationships and so no object
loading optimisation is possible.  For example:

   d = Dungeon.first
   t = d.traps.first
   d.level == t.dungeon.level # => true
   d.level = 10
   d.level == t.dungeon.level # => false

The +Dungeon+ instances +d+ and <tt>t.dungeon</tt> in the above example refer to
the same object data from the database, but are actually different in-memory copies
of that data.  Specifying the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option on associations lets you tell
Active Record about inverse relationships and it will optimise object loading.  For
example, if we changed our model definitions to:

   class Dungeon < ActiveRecord::Base
     has_many :traps, :inverse_of => :dungeon
     has_one :evil_wizard, :inverse_of => :dungeon
   end

   class Trap < ActiveRecord::Base
     belongs_to :dungeon, :inverse_of => :traps
   end

   class EvilWizard < ActiveRecord::Base
     belongs_to :dungeon, :inverse_of => :evil_wizard
   end

Then, from our code snippet above, +d+ and <tt>t.dungeon</tt> are actually the same
in-memory instance and our final <tt>d.level == t.dungeon.level</tt> will return +true+.

There are limitations to <tt>:inverse_of</tt> support:

* does not work with <tt>:through</tt> associations.
* does not work with <tt>:polymorphic</tt> associations.
* for +belongs_to+ associations +has_many+ inverse associations are ignored.

== Deleting from associations

=== Dependent associations

+has_many+, +has_one+ and +belongs_to+ associations support the <tt>:dependent</tt> option.
This allows you to specify that associated records should be deleted when the owner is
deleted.

For example:

    class Author
      has_many :posts, :dependent => :destroy
    end
    Author.find(1).destroy # => Will destroy all of the author's posts, too

The <tt>:dependent</tt> option can have different values which specify how the deletion
is done. For more information, see the documentation for this option on the different
specific association types.

=== Delete or destroy?

+has_many+ and +has_and_belongs_to_many+ associations have the methods <tt>destroy</tt>,
<tt>delete</tt>, <tt>destroy_all</tt> and <tt>delete_all</tt>.

For +has_and_belongs_to_many+, <tt>delete</tt> and <tt>destroy</tt> are the same: they
cause the records in the join table to be removed.

For +has_many+, <tt>destroy</tt> will always call the <tt>destroy</tt> method of the
record(s) being removed so that callbacks are run. However <tt>delete</tt> will either
do the deletion according to the strategy specified by the <tt>:dependent</tt> option, or
if no <tt>:dependent</tt> option is given, then it will follow the default strategy.
The default strategy is <tt>:nullify</tt> (set the foreign keys to <tt>nil</tt>), except for
+has_many+ <tt>:through</tt>, where the default strategy is <tt>delete_all</tt> (delete
the join records, without running their callbacks).

There is also a <tt>clear</tt> method which is the same as <tt>delete_all</tt>, except that
it returns the association rather than the records which have been deleted.

=== What gets deleted?

There is a potential pitfall here: +has_and_belongs_to_many+ and +has_many+ <tt>:through</tt>
associations have records in join tables, as well as the associated records. So when we
call one of these deletion methods, what exactly should be deleted?

The answer is that it is assumed that deletion on an association is about removing the
<i>link</i> between the owner and the associated object(s), rather than necessarily the
associated objects themselves. So with +has_and_belongs_to_many+ and +has_many+
<tt>:through</tt>, the join records will be deleted, but the associated records won't.

This makes sense if you think about it: if you were to call <tt>post.tags.delete(Tag.find_by_name('food'))</tt>
you would want the 'food' tag to be unlinked from the post, rather than for the tag itself
to be removed from the database.

However, there are examples where this strategy doesn't make sense. For example, suppose
a person has many projects, and each project has many tasks. If we deleted one of a person's
tasks, we would probably not want the project to be deleted. In this scenario, the delete method
won't actually work: it can only be used if the association on the join model is a
+belongs_to+. In other situations you are expected to perform operations directly on
either the associated records or the <tt>:through</tt> association.

With a regular +has_many+ there is no distinction between the "associated records"
and the "link", so there is only one choice for what gets deleted.

With +has_and_belongs_to_many+ and +has_many+ <tt>:through</tt>, if you want to delete the
associated records themselves, you can always do something along the lines of
<tt>person.tasks.each(&:destroy)</tt>.

== Type safety with <tt>ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch</tt>

If you attempt to assign an object to an association that doesn't match the inferred
or specified <tt>:class_name</tt>, you'll get an <tt>ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch</tt>.

== Options

All of the association macros can be specialized through options. This makes cases
more complex than the simple and guessable ones possible.
