<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::HasManyAssociation#inverse_updates_counter_cache?</h1>

This shit is nasty. We need to avoid the following situation:

  * An associated record is deleted via record.destroy
  * Hence the callbacks run, and they find a belongs_to on the record with a
    :counter_cache options which points back at our owner. So they update the
    counter cache.
  * In which case, we must make sure to *not* update the counter cache, or else
    it will be decremented twice.

Hence this method.
