<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#stale_target?</h1>

The target is stale if the target no longer points to the record(s) that the
relevant foreign_key(s) refers to. If stale, the association accessor method
on the owner will reload the target. It's up to subclasses to implement the
state_state method if relevant.

Note that if the target has not been loaded, it is not considered stale.
