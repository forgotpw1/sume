<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#stale_state</h1>

This should be implemented to return the values of the relevant key(s) on the owner,
so that when state_state is different from the value stored on the last find_target,
the target is stale.

This is only relevant to certain associations, which is why it returns nil by default.
