<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#load_target</h1>

Loads the \target if needed and returns it.

This method is abstract in the sense that it relies on +find_target+,
which is expected to be provided by descendants.

If the \target is already \loaded it is just returned. Thus, you can call
+load_target+ unconditionally to get the \target.

ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound is rescued within the method, and it is
not reraised. The proxy is \reset and +nil+ is the return value.
