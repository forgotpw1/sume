<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#load_target</h1>


<p>Loads the target if needed and returns it.</p>

<p>This method is abstract in the sense that it relies on
<tt>find_target</tt>, which is expected to be provided by descendants.</p>

<p>If the target is already loaded it is just returned. Thus, you can call
<tt>load_target</tt> unconditionally to get the target.</p>

<p>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound is rescued within the method, and it is not
reraised. The proxy is reset and <tt>nil</tt> is the return value.</p>
