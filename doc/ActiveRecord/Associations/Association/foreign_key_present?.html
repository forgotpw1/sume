<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#foreign_key_present?</h1>

Should be true if there is a foreign key present on the owner which
references the target. This is used to determine whether we can load
the target if the owner is currently a new record (and therefore
without a key).

Currently implemented by belongs_to (vanilla and polymorphic) and
has_one/has_many :through associations which go through a belongs_to
