<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#association_scope</h1>

The scope for this association.

Note that the association_scope is merged into the target_scope only when the
scoped method is called. This is because at that point the call may be surrounded
by scope.scoping { ... } or with_scope { ... } etc, which affects the scope which
actually gets built.
