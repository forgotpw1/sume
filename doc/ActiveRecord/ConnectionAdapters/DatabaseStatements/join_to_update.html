<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::DatabaseStatements#join_to_update</h1>

The default strategy for an UPDATE with joins is to use a subquery. This doesn't work
on mysql (even when aliasing the tables), but mysql allows using JOIN directly in
an UPDATE statement, so in the mysql adapters we redefine this to do that.
