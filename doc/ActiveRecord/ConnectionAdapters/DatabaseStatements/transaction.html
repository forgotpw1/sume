<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::DatabaseStatements#transaction</h1>


<p>Runs the given block in a database transaction, and returns the result of
the block.</p>

<h2>Nested transactions support</h2>

<p>Most databases don't support true nested transactions. At the time of
writing, the only database that supports true nested transactions that
we're aware of, is MS-SQL.</p>

<p>In order to get around this problem, #transaction will emulate the effect
of nested transactions, by using savepoints: <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/savepoints.html">dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/savepoints.html</a>
Savepoints are supported by MySQL and PostgreSQL, but not SQLite3.</p>

<p>It is safe to call this method if a database transaction is already open,
i.e. if #transaction is called within another #transaction block. In case
of a nested call, #transaction will behave as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The block will be run without doing anything. All database statements that
happen within the block are effectively appended to the already open
database transaction.</p>
</li><li>
<p>However, if <tt>:requires_new</tt> is set, the block will be wrapped in a
database savepoint acting as a sub-transaction.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>MySQL doesn't support DDL transactions. If you perform a DDL operation,
then any created savepoints will be automatically released. For example, if
you've created a savepoint, then you execute a CREATE TABLE statement, then
the savepoint that was created will be automatically released.</p>

<p>This means that, on MySQL, you shouldn't execute DDL operations inside a
#transaction call that you know might create a savepoint. Otherwise,
#transaction will raise exceptions when it tries to release the
already-automatically-released savepoints:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">Model.connection.transaction do  # BEGIN
  Model.connection.transaction(:requires_new =&gt; true) do  # CREATE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
    Model.connection.create_table(...)
    # active_record_1 now automatically released
  end  # RELEASE SAVEPOINT active_record_1  &lt;--- BOOM! database error!
end</pre>
