<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::DatabaseStatements#outside_transaction?</h1>


<p>Checks whether there is currently no transaction active. This is done by
querying the database driver, and does not use the transaction
house-keeping information recorded by #increment_open_transactions and
friends.</p>

<p>Returns true if there is no transaction active, false if there is a
transaction active, and nil if this information is unknown.</p>

<p>Not all adapters supports transaction state introspection. Currently, only
the PostgreSQL adapter supports this.</p>
