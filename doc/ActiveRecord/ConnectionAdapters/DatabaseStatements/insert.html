<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::DatabaseStatements#insert</h1>


<p>Returns the last auto-generated ID from the affected table.</p>

<p><tt>id_value</tt> will be returned unless the value is nil, in which case
the database will attempt to calculate the last inserted id and return that
value.</p>

<p>If the next id was calculated in advance (as in Oracle), it should be
passed in as <tt>id_value</tt>.</p>
