<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractMysqlAdapter#emulate_booleans</h1>

:singleton-method:
By default, the MysqlAdapter will consider all columns of type <tt>tinyint(1)</tt>
as boolean. If you wish to disable this emulation (which was the default
behavior in versions 0.13.1 and earlier) you can add the following line
to your application.rb file:

  ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Mysql[2]Adapter.emulate_booleans = false
