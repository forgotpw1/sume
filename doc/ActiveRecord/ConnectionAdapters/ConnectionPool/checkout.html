<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool#checkout</h1>

Check-out a database connection from the pool, indicating that you want
to use it. You should call #checkin when you no longer need this.

This is done by either returning and leasing existing connection, or by
creating a new connection and leasing it.

If all connections are leased and the pool is at capacity (meaning the
number of currently leased connections is greater than or equal to the
size limit set), an ActiveRecord::PoolFullError exception will be raised.

Returns: an AbstractAdapter object.

Raises:
- PoolFullError: no connection can be obtained from the pool.
