<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionHandler#retrieve_connection</h1>


<p>Locate the connection of the nearest super class. This can be an active or
defined connection: if it is the latter, it will be opened and set as the
active connection for the class it was defined for (not necessarily the
current class).</p>
