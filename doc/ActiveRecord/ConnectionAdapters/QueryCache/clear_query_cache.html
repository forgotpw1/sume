<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::QueryCache#clear_query_cache</h1>


<p>Clears the query cache.</p>

<p>One reason you may wish to call this method explicitly is between queries
that ask the database to randomize results. Otherwise the cache would see
the same SQL query and repeatedly return the same result each time,
silently undermining the randomness you were expecting.</p>
