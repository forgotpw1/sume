<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractAdapter#prefetch_primary_key?</h1>


<p>Should primary key values be selected from their corresponding sequence
before the insert statement? If true, next_sequence_value is called before
each insert to set the record's primary key. This is false for all adapters
but Firebird.</p>
