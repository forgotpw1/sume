<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractAdapter#raw_connection</h1>

Provides access to the underlying database driver for this adapter. For
example, this method returns a Mysql object in case of MysqlAdapter,
and a PGconn object in case of PostgreSQLAdapter.

This is useful for when you need to call a proprietary method such as
PostgreSQL's lo_* methods.
