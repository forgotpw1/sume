<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractAdapter#reset!</h1>

Reset the state of this connection, directing the DBMS to clear
transactions and other connection-related server-side state. Usually a
database-dependent operation.

The default implementation does nothing; the implementation should be
overridden by concrete adapters.
