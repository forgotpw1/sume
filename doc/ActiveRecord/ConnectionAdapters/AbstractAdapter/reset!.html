<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractAdapter#reset!</h1>


<p>Reset the state of this connection, directing the DBMS to clear
transactions and other connection-related server-side state. Usually a
database-dependent operation.</p>

<p>The default implementation does nothing; the implementation should be
overridden by concrete adapters.</p>
