<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::MysqlAdapter#emulate_booleans</h1>


<p>:singleton-method: By default, the MysqlAdapter will consider all columns
of type <tt>tinyint(1)</tt> as boolean. If you wish to disable this
emulation (which was the default behavior in versions 0.13.1 and earlier)
you can add the following line to your application.rb file:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::MysqlAdapter.emulate_booleans = false</pre>
