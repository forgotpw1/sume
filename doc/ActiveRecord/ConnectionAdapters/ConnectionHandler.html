ConnectionHandler is a collection of ConnectionPool objects. It is used
for keeping separate connection pools for Active Record models that connect
to different databases.

For example, suppose that you have 5 models, with the following hierarchy:

 |
 +-- Book
 |    |
 |    +-- ScaryBook
 |    +-- GoodBook
 +-- Author
 +-- BankAccount

Suppose that Book is to connect to a separate database (i.e. one other
than the default database). Then Book, ScaryBook and GoodBook will all use
the same connection pool. Likewise, Author and BankAccount will use the
same connection pool. However, the connection pool used by Author/BankAccount
is not the same as the one used by Book/ScaryBook/GoodBook.

Normally there is only a single ConnectionHandler instance, accessible via
ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler. Active Record models use this to
determine that connection pool that they should use.
