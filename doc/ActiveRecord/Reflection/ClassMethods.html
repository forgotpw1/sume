Reflection enables to interrogate Active Record classes and objects
about their associations and aggregations. This information can,
for example, be used in a form builder that takes an Active Record object
and creates input fields for all of the attributes depending on their type
and displays the associations to other objects.

MacroReflection class has info for AggregateReflection and AssociationReflection
classes.
