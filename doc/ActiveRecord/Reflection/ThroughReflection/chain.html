<h1>ActiveRecord::Reflection::ThroughReflection#chain</h1>

Returns an array of reflections which are involved in this association. Each item in the
array corresponds to a table which will be part of the query for this association.

The chain is built by recursively calling #chain on the source reflection and the through
reflection. The base case for the recursion is a normal association, which just returns
[self] as its #chain.
