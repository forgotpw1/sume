<h1>ActiveRecord::Sanitization::ClassMethods#sanitize_sql_hash_for_conditions</h1>

Sanitizes a hash of attribute/value pairs into SQL conditions for a WHERE clause.
  { :name => "foo'bar", :group_id => 4 }
    # => "name='foo''bar' and group_id= 4"
  { :status => nil, :group_id => [1,2,3] }
    # => "status IS NULL and group_id IN (1,2,3)"
  { :age => 13..18 }
    # => "age BETWEEN 13 AND 18"
  { 'other_records.id' => 7 }
    # => "`other_records`.`id` = 7"
  { :other_records => { :id => 7 } }
    # => "`other_records`.`id` = 7"
And for value objects on a composed_of relationship:
  { :address => Address.new("123 abc st.", "chicago") }
    # => "address_street='123 abc st.' and address_city='chicago'"
