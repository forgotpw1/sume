<h1>ActiveRecord::Sanitization::ClassMethods#expand_hash_conditions_for_aggregates</h1>

that correspond to a +composed_of+ relationship with their expanded
aggregate attribute values.
Given:
    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
      composed_of :address, :class_name => "Address",
        :mapping => [%w(address_street street), %w(address_city city)]
    end
Then:
    { :address => Address.new("813 abc st.", "chicago") }
      # => { :address_street => "813 abc st.", :address_city => "chicago" }
