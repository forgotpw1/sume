<h1>ActiveRecord::Calculations#pluck</h1>

Use <tt>pluck</tt> as a shortcut to select a single attribute without
loading a bunch of records just to grab one attribute you want.

  Person.pluck(:name)

instead of

  Person.all.map(&:name)

Pluck returns an <tt>Array</tt> of attribute values type-casted to match
the plucked column name, if it can be deduced. Plucking a SQL fragment
returns String values by default.

Examples:

  Person.pluck(:id)
  # SELECT people.id FROM people
  # => [1, 2, 3]

  Person.uniq.pluck(:role)
  # SELECT DISTINCT role FROM people
  # => ['admin', 'member', 'guest']

  Person.where(:age => 21).limit(5).pluck(:id)
  # SELECT people.id FROM people WHERE people.age = 21 LIMIT 5
  # => [2, 3]

  Person.pluck('DATEDIFF(updated_at, created_at)')
  # SELECT DATEDIFF(updated_at, created_at) FROM people
  # => ['0', '27761', '173']
