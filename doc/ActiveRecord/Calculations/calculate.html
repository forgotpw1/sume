<h1>ActiveRecord::Calculations#calculate</h1>


<p>This calculates aggregate values in the given column.  Methods for count,
sum, average, minimum, and maximum have been added as shortcuts. Options
such as <tt>:conditions</tt>, <tt>:order</tt>, <tt>:group</tt>,
<tt>:having</tt>, and <tt>:joins</tt> can be passed to customize the query.</p>

<p>There are two basic forms of output:</p>

<pre>* Single aggregate value: The single value is type cast to Fixnum for COUNT, Float
  for AVG, and the given column's type for everything else.
* Grouped values: This returns an ordered hash of the values and groups them by the
  &lt;tt&gt;:group&lt;/tt&gt; option.  It takes either a column name, or the name of a belongs_to association.

    values = Person.maximum(:age, :group =&gt; 'last_name')
    puts values[&quot;Drake&quot;]
    =&gt; 43

    drake  = Family.find_by_last_name('Drake')
    values = Person.maximum(:age, :group =&gt; :family) # Person belongs_to :family
    puts values[drake]
    =&gt; 43

    values.each do |family, max_age|
    ...
    end</pre>

<p>Options:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:conditions</tt> - An SQL fragment like "administrator = 1" or [
"user_name = ?", username ]. See conditions in the intro to
ActiveRecord::Base.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:include</tt>: Eager loading, see Associations for details.  Since
calculations don't load anything, the purpose of this is to access fields
on joined tables in your conditions, order, or group clauses.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:joins</tt> - An SQL fragment for additional joins like "LEFT JOIN
comments ON comments.post_id = id". (Rarely needed). The records will be
returned read-only since they will have attributes that do not correspond
to the table's columns.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:order</tt> - An SQL fragment like "created_at DESC, name" (really only
used with GROUP BY calculations).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:group</tt> - An attribute name by which the result should be grouped.
Uses the GROUP BY SQL-clause.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:select</tt> - By default, this is * as in SELECT * FROM, but can be
changed if you for example want to do a join, but not include the joined
columns.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:distinct</tt> - Set this to true to make this a distinct calculation,
such as SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.id) ...</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>Person.calculate(:count, :all) # The same as Person.count
Person.average(:age) # SELECT AVG(age) FROM people...
Person.minimum(:age, :conditions =&gt; ['last_name != ?', 'Drake']) # Selects the minimum age for
                                                                 # everyone with a last name other than 'Drake'

# Selects the minimum age for any family without any minors
Person.minimum(:age, :having =&gt; 'min(age) &gt; 17', :group =&gt; :last_name)

Person.sum(&quot;2 * age&quot;)</pre>
