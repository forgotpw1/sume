<h1>ActiveRecord::Core#encode_with</h1>

Populate +coder+ with attributes about this record that should be
serialized. The structure of +coder+ defined in this method is
guaranteed to match the structure of +coder+ passed to the +init_with+
method.

Example:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  end
  coder = {}
  Post.new.encode_with(coder)
  coder # => {"attributes" => {"id" => nil, ... }}
