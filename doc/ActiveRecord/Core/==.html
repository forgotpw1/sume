<h1>ActiveRecord::Core#==</h1>

Returns true if +comparison_object+ is the same exact object, or +comparison_object+
is of the same type and +self+ has an ID and it is equal to +comparison_object.id+.

Note that new records are different from any other record by definition, unless the
other record is the receiver itself. Besides, if you fetch existing records with
+select+ and leave the ID out, you're on your own, this predicate will return false.

Note also that destroying a record preserves its ID in the model instance, so deleted
models are still comparable.
