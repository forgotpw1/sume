<h1>ActiveRecord::Core#to_ary</h1>

Under Ruby 1.9, Array#flatten will call #to_ary (recursively) on each of the elements
of the array, and then rescues from the possible NoMethodError. If those elements are
ActiveRecord::Base's, then this triggers the various method_missing's that we have,
which significantly impacts upon performance.

So we can avoid the method_missing hit by explicitly defining #to_ary as nil here.
