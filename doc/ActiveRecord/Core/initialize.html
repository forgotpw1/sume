<h1>ActiveRecord::Core#initialize</h1>

New objects can be instantiated as either empty (pass no construction parameter) or pre-set with
attributes but not yet saved (pass a hash with key names matching the associated table column names).
In both instances, valid attribute keys are determined by the column names of the associated table --
hence you can't have attributes that aren't part of the table columns.

+initialize+ respects mass-assignment security and accepts either +:as+ or +:without_protection+ options
in the +options+ parameter.

==== Examples
  # Instantiates a single new object
  User.new(:first_name => 'Jamie')

  # Instantiates a single new object using the :admin mass-assignment security role
  User.new({ :first_name => 'Jamie', :is_admin => true }, :as => :admin)

  # Instantiates a single new object bypassing mass-assignment security
  User.new({ :first_name => 'Jamie', :is_admin => true }, :without_protection => true)
