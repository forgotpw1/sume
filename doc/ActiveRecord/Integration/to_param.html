<h1>ActiveRecord::Integration#to_param</h1>

Returns a String, which Action Pack uses for constructing an URL to this
object. The default implementation returns this record's id as a String,
or nil if this record's unsaved.

For example, suppose that you have a User model, and that you have a
<tt>resources :users</tt> route. Normally, +user_path+ will
construct a path with the user object's 'id' in it:

  user = User.find_by_name('Phusion')
  user_path(user)  # => "/users/1"

You can override +to_param+ in your model to make +user_path+ construct
a path using the user's name instead of the user's id:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    def to_param  # overridden
      name
    end
  end

  user = User.find_by_name('Phusion')
  user_path(user)  # => "/users/Phusion"
