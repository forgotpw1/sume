<h1>ActiveRecord::Batches#find_each</h1>


<p>Yields each record that was found by the find <tt>options</tt>. The find is
performed by find_in_batches with a batch size of 1000 (or as specified by
the <tt>:batch_size</tt> option).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">Person.where(&quot;age &gt; 21&quot;).find_each do |person|
  person.party_all_night!
end</pre>

<p>Note: This method is only intended to use for batch processing of large
amounts of records that wouldn't fit in memory all at once. If you just
need to loop over less than 1000 records, it's probably better just to use
the regular find methods.</p>
