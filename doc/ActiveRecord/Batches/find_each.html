<h1>ActiveRecord::Batches#find_each</h1>

Yields each record that was found by the find +options+. The find is
performed by find_in_batches with a batch size of 1000 (or as
specified by the <tt>:batch_size</tt> option).

Example:

  Person.where("age > 21").find_each do |person|
    person.party_all_night!
  end

Note: This method is only intended to use for batch processing of
large amounts of records that wouldn't fit in memory all at once. If
you just need to loop over less than 1000 records, it's probably
better just to use the regular find methods.
