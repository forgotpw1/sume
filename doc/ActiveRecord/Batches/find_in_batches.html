<h1>ActiveRecord::Batches#find_in_batches</h1>

Yields each batch of records that was found by the find +options+ as
an array. The size of each batch is set by the <tt>:batch_size</tt>
option; the default is 1000.

You can control the starting point for the batch processing by
supplying the <tt>:start</tt> option. This is especially useful if you
want multiple workers dealing with the same processing queue. You can
make worker 1 handle all the records between id 0 and 10,000 and
worker 2 handle from 10,000 and beyond (by setting the <tt>:start</tt>
option on that worker).

It's not possible to set the order. That is automatically set to
ascending on the primary key ("id ASC") to make the batch ordering
work. This also mean that this method only works with integer-based
primary keys. You can't set the limit either, that's used to control
the batch sizes.

Example:

  Person.where("age > 21").find_in_batches do |group|
    sleep(50) # Make sure it doesn't get too crowded in there!
    group.each { |person| person.party_all_night! }
  end
