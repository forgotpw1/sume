<h1>ActiveRecord::Batches#find_in_batches</h1>


<p>Yields each batch of records that was found by the find <tt>options</tt> as
an array. The size of each batch is set by the <tt>:batch_size</tt> option;
the default is 1000.</p>

<p>You can control the starting point for the batch processing by supplying
the <tt>:start</tt> option. This is especially useful if you want multiple
workers dealing with the same processing queue. You can make worker 1
handle all the records between id 0 and 10,000 and worker 2 handle from
10,000 and beyond (by setting the <tt>:start</tt> option on that worker).</p>

<p>It's not possible to set the order. That is automatically set to ascending
on the primary key ("id ASC") to make the batch ordering work. This also
mean that this method only works with integer-based primary keys. You can't
set the limit either, that's used to control the batch sizes.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">Person.where(&quot;age &gt; 21&quot;).find_in_batches do |group|
  sleep(50) # Make sure it doesn't get too crowded in there!
  group.each { |person| person.party_all_night! }
end</pre>
