<h1>ActiveRecord::Base#primary_key_prefix_type</h1>


<p>:singleton-method: Accessor for the prefix type that will be prepended to
every primary key column name. The options are :table_name and
:table_name_with_underscore. If the first is specified, the Product class
will look for "productid" instead of "id" as the primary column. If the
latter is specified, the Product class will look for "product_id" instead
of "id". Remember that this is a global setting for all Active Records.</p>
