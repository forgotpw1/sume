<h1>ActiveRecord::Base.unscoped</h1>


<p>Returns a scope for this class without taking into account the
default_scope.</p>

<pre>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.default_scope
    where :published =&gt; true
  end
end

Post.all          # Fires &quot;SELECT * FROM posts WHERE published = true&quot;
Post.unscoped.all # Fires &quot;SELECT * FROM posts&quot;</pre>

<p>This method also accepts a block meaning that all queries inside the block
will not use the default_scope:</p>

<pre>Post.unscoped {
  Post.limit(10) # Fires &quot;SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 10&quot;
}</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use block form of unscoped because chaining unscoped
with <tt>scope</tt> does not work. Assuming that <tt>published</tt> is a
<tt>scope</tt> following two statements are same.</p>

<p>Post.unscoped.published Post.published</p>
