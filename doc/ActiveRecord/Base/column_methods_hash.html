<h1>ActiveRecord::Base.column_methods_hash</h1>


<p>Returns a hash of all the methods added to query each of the columns in the
table with the name of the method as the key and true as the value. This
makes it possible to do O(1) lookups in respond_to? to check if a given
method for attribute is available.</p>
