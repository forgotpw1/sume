<h1>ActiveRecord::Base#eql?</h1>


<p>Returns true if <tt>comparison_object</tt> is the same exact object, or
<tt>comparison_object</tt> is of the same type and <tt>self</tt> has an ID
and it is equal to <tt>comparison_object.id</tt>.</p>

<p>Note that new records are different from any other record by definition,
unless the other record is the receiver itself. Besides, if you fetch
existing records with <tt>select</tt> and leave the ID out, you're on your
own, this predicate will return false.</p>

<p>Note also that destroying a record preserves its ID in the model instance,
so deleted models are still comparable.</p>
