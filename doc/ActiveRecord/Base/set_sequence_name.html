<h1>ActiveRecord::Base.set_sequence_name</h1>


<p>Sets the name of the sequence to use when generating ids to the given
value, or (if the value is nil or false) to the value returned by the given
block. This is required for Oracle and is useful for any database which
relies on sequences for primary key generation.</p>

<p>If a sequence name is not explicitly set when using Oracle or Firebird, it
will default to the commonly used pattern of: #{table_name}_seq</p>

<p>If a sequence name is not explicitly set when using PostgreSQL, it will
discover the sequence corresponding to your primary key for you.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  set_sequence_name &quot;projectseq&quot;   # default would have been &quot;project_seq&quot;
end</pre>
