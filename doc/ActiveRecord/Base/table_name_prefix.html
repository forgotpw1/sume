<h1>ActiveRecord::Base#table_name_prefix</h1>


<p>:singleton-method: Accessor for the name of the prefix string to prepend to
every table name. So if set to "basecamp_", all table names will be named
like "basecamp_projects", "basecamp_people", etc. This is a convenient way
of creating a namespace for tables in a shared database. By default, the
prefix is the empty string.</p>

<p>If you are organising your models within modules you can add a prefix to
the models within a namespace by defining a singleton method in the parent
module called table_name_prefix which returns your chosen prefix.</p>
