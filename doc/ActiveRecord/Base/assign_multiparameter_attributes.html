<h1>ActiveRecord::Base#assign_multiparameter_attributes</h1>


<p>Instantiates objects for all attribute classes that needs more than one
constructor parameter. This is done by calling new on the column type or
aggregation type (through composed_of) object with these parameters. So
having the pairs written_on(1) = "2004", written_on(2) = "6", written_on(3)
= "24", will instantiate written_on (a date type) with Date.new("2004",
"6", "24"). You can also specify a typecast character in the parentheses to
have the parameters typecasted before they're used in the constructor. Use
i for Fixnum, f for Float, s for String, and a for Array. If all the values
for a given attribute are empty, the attribute will be set to nil.</p>
