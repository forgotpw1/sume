<h1>ActiveRecord::Base#schema_format</h1>


<p>:singleton-method: Specifies the format to use when dumping the database
schema with Rails' Rakefile. If :sql, the schema is dumped as (potentially
database- specific) SQL statements. If :ruby, the schema is dumped as an
ActiveRecord::Schema file which can be loaded into any database that
supports migrations. Use :ruby if you want to have different database
adapters for, e.g., your development and test environments.</p>
