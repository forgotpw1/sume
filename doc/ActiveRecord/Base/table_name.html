<h1>ActiveRecord::Base.table_name</h1>


<p>Guesses the table name (in forced lower-case) based on the name of the
class in the inheritance hierarchy descending directly from
ActiveRecord::Base. So if the hierarchy looks like: Reply &lt; Message &lt;
ActiveRecord::Base, then Message is used to guess the table name even when
called on Reply. The rules used to do the guess are handled by the
Inflector class in Active Support, which knows almost all common English
inflections. You can add new inflections in
config/initializers/inflections.rb.</p>

<p>Nested classes are given table names prefixed by the singular form of the
parent's table name. Enclosing modules are not considered.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre data-language="ruby">class Invoice &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

file                  class               table_name
invoice.rb            Invoice             invoices

class Invoice &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  class Lineitem &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  end
end

file                  class               table_name
invoice.rb            Invoice::Lineitem   invoice_lineitems

module Invoice
  class Lineitem &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  end
end

file                  class               table_name
invoice/lineitem.rb   Invoice::Lineitem   lineitems</pre>

<p>Additionally, the class-level <tt>table_name_prefix</tt> is prepended and
the <tt>table_name_suffix</tt> is appended. So if you have "myapp_" as a
prefix, the table name guess for an Invoice class becomes "myapp_invoices".
Invoice::Lineitem becomes "myapp_invoice_lineitems".</p>

<p>You can also overwrite this class method to allow for unguessable links,
such as a Mouse class with a link to a "mice" table. Example:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">class Mouse &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  set_table_name &quot;mice&quot;
end</pre>
