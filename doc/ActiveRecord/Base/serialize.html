<h1>ActiveRecord::Base.serialize</h1>


<p>If you have an attribute that needs to be saved to the database as an
object, and retrieved as the same object, then specify the name of that
attribute using this method and it will be handled automatically. The
serialization is done through YAML. If <tt>class_name</tt> is specified,
the serialized object must be of that class on retrieval or
SerializationTypeMismatch will be raised.</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>attr_name</tt> - The field name that should be serialized.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>class_name</tt> - Optional, class name that the object type should be
equal to.</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre># Serialize a preferences attribute
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize :preferences
end</pre>
