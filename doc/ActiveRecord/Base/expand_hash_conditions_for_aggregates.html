<h1>ActiveRecord::Base.expand_hash_conditions_for_aggregates</h1>


<p>Accepts a hash of SQL conditions and replaces those attributes that
correspond to a <tt>composed_of</tt> relationship with their expanded
aggregate attribute values. Given:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  composed_of :address, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Address&quot;,
    :mapping =&gt; [%w(address_street street), %w(address_city city)]
end</pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">{ :address =&gt; Address.new(&quot;813 abc st.&quot;, &quot;chicago&quot;) }
  # =&gt; { :address_street =&gt; &quot;813 abc st.&quot;, :address_city =&gt; &quot;chicago&quot; }</pre>
