<h1>ActiveRecord::Base.default_scope</h1>


<p>Use this macro in your model to set a default scope for all operations on
the model.</p>

<pre>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  default_scope where(:published =&gt; true)
end

Article.all # =&gt; SELECT * FROM articles WHERE published = true</pre>

<p>The <tt>default_scope</tt> is also applied while creating/building a
record. It is not applied while updating a record.</p>

<pre>Article.new.published    # =&gt; true
Article.create.published # =&gt; true</pre>

<p>You can also use <tt>default_scope</tt> with a block, in order to have it
lazily evaluated:</p>

<pre>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  default_scope { where(:published_at =&gt; Time.now - 1.week) }
end</pre>

<p>(You can also pass any object which responds to <tt>call</tt> to the
<tt>default_scope</tt> macro, and it will be called when building the
default scope.)</p>

<p>If you use multiple <tt>default_scope</tt> declarations in your model then
they will be merged together:</p>

<pre>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  default_scope where(:published =&gt; true)
  default_scope where(:rating =&gt; 'G')
end

Article.all # =&gt; SELECT * FROM articles WHERE published = true AND rating = 'G'</pre>

<p>This is also the case with inheritance and module includes where the parent
or module defines a <tt>default_scope</tt> and the child or including class
defines a second one.</p>

<p>If you need to do more complex things with a default scope, you can
alternatively define it as a class method:</p>

<pre>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.default_scope
    # Should return a scope, you can call 'super' here etc.
  end
end</pre>
