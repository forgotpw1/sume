<h1>ActiveRecord::Base#initialize_dup</h1>


<p>Duped objects have no id assigned and are treated as new records. Note that
this is a "shallow" copy as it copies the object's attributes only, not its
associations. The extent of a "deep" copy is application specific and is
therefore left to the application to implement according to its need. The
dup method does not preserve the timestamps (created|updated)_(at|on).</p>
