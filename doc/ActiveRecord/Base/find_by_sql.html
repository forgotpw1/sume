<h1>ActiveRecord::Base.find_by_sql</h1>


<p>Executes a custom SQL query against your database and returns all the
results. The results will be returned as an array with columns requested
encapsulated as attributes of the model you call this method from. If you
call <tt>Product.find_by_sql</tt> then the results will be returned in a
Product object with the attributes you specified in the SQL query.</p>

<p>If you call a complicated SQL query which spans multiple tables the columns
specified by the SELECT will be attributes of the model, whether or not
they are columns of the corresponding table.</p>

<p>The <tt>sql</tt> parameter is a full SQL query as a string. It will be
called as is, there will be no database agnostic conversions performed.
This should be a last resort because using, for example, MySQL specific
terms will lock you to using that particular database engine or require you
to change your call if you switch engines.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre data-language="ruby"># A simple SQL query spanning multiple tables
Post.find_by_sql &quot;SELECT p.title, c.author FROM posts p, comments c WHERE p.id = c.post_id&quot;
&gt; [#&lt;Post:0x36bff9c @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;Ruby Meetup&quot;, &quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Quentin&quot;}&gt;, ...]

# You can use the same string replacement techniques as you can with ActiveRecord#find
Post.find_by_sql [&quot;SELECT title FROM posts WHERE author = ? AND created &gt; ?&quot;, author_id, start_date]
&gt; [#&lt;Post:0x36bff9c @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;The Cheap Man Buys Twice&quot;}&gt;, ...]</pre>
