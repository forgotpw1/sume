<h1>ActiveRecord::Base#ensure_proper_type</h1>


<p>Sets the attribute used for single table inheritance to this class name if
this is not the ActiveRecord::Base descendant. Considering the hierarchy
Reply &lt; Message &lt; ActiveRecord::Base, this makes it possible to do
Reply.new without having to set <tt>Reply[Reply.inheritance_column] =
&quot;Reply&quot;</tt> yourself. No such attribute would be set for objects
of the Message class in that example.</p>
