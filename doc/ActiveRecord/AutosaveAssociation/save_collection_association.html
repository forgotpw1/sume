<h1>ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation#save_collection_association</h1>


<p>Saves any new associated records, or all loaded autosave associations if
<tt>:autosave</tt> is enabled on the association.</p>

<p>In addition, it destroys all children that were marked for destruction with
mark_for_destruction.</p>

<p>This all happens inside a transaction, <em>if</em> the Transactions module
is included into ActiveRecord::Base after the AutosaveAssociation module,
which it does by default.</p>
