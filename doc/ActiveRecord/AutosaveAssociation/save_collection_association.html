<h1>ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation#save_collection_association</h1>

Saves any new associated records, or all loaded autosave associations if
<tt>:autosave</tt> is enabled on the association.

In addition, it destroys all children that were marked for destruction
with mark_for_destruction.

This all happens inside a transaction, _if_ the Transactions module is included into
ActiveRecord::Base after the AutosaveAssociation module, which it does by default.
