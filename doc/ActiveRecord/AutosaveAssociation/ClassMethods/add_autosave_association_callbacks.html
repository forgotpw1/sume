<h1>ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation::ClassMethods#add_autosave_association_callbacks</h1>

Adds validation and save callbacks for the association as specified by
the +reflection+.

For performance reasons, we don't check whether to validate at runtime.
However the validation and callback methods are lazy and those methods
get created when they are invoked for the very first time. However,
this can change, for instance, when using nested attributes, which is
called _after_ the association has been defined. Since we don't want
the callbacks to get defined multiple times, there are guards that
check if the save or validation methods have already been defined
before actually defining them.
