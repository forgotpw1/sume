<h1>ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation::ClassMethods#add_autosave_association_callbacks</h1>


<p>Adds validation and save callbacks for the association as specified by the
<tt>reflection</tt>.</p>

<p>For performance reasons, we don't check whether to validate at runtime.
However the validation and callback methods are lazy and those methods get
created when they are invoked for the very first time.  However, this can
change, for instance, when using nested attributes, which is called
<em>after</em> the association has been defined. Since we don't want the
callbacks to get defined multiple times, there are guards that check if the
save or validation methods have already been defined before actually
defining them.</p>
