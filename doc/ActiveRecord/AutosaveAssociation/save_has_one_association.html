<h1>ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation#save_has_one_association</h1>

Saves the associated record if it's new or <tt>:autosave</tt> is enabled
on the association.

In addition, it will destroy the association if it was marked for
destruction with mark_for_destruction.

This all happens inside a transaction, _if_ the Transactions module is included into
ActiveRecord::Base after the AutosaveAssociation module, which it does by default.
