<h1>ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation#save_has_one_association</h1>


<p>Saves the associated record if it's new or <tt>:autosave</tt> is enabled on
the association.</p>

<p>In addition, it will destroy the association if it was marked for
destruction with mark_for_destruction.</p>

<p>This all happens inside a transaction, <em>if</em> the Transactions module
is included into ActiveRecord::Base after the AutosaveAssociation module,
which it does by default.</p>
