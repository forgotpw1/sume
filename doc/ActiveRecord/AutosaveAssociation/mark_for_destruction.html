<h1>ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation#mark_for_destruction</h1>

Marks this record to be destroyed as part of the parents save transaction.
This does _not_ actually destroy the record instantly, rather child record will be destroyed
when <tt>parent.save</tt> is called.

Only useful if the <tt>:autosave</tt> option on the parent is enabled for this associated model.
