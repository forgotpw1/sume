<h1>ActiveRecord::Inheritance::ClassMethods#abstract_class=</h1>

Set this to true if this is an abstract class (see <tt>abstract_class?</tt>).
If you are using inheritance with ActiveRecord and don't want child classes
to utilize the implied STI table name of the parent class, this will need to be true.
For example, given the following:

  class SuperClass < ActiveRecord::Base
    self.abstract_class = true
  end
  class Child < SuperClass
    self.table_name = 'the_table_i_really_want'
  end


<tt>self.abstract_class = true</tt> is required to make <tt>Child<.find,.create, or any Arel method></tt> use <tt>the_table_i_really_want</tt> instead of a table called <tt>super_classes</tt>
