<h1>ActiveRecord::Inheritance::ClassMethods#base_class</h1>

Returns the base AR subclass that this class descends from. If A
extends AR::Base, A.base_class will return A. If B descends from A
through some arbitrarily deep hierarchy, B.base_class will return A.

If B < A and C < B and if A is an abstract_class then both B.base_class
and C.base_class would return B as the answer since A is an abstract_class.
