<h1>ActiveRecord::Inheritance#ensure_proper_type</h1>

Sets the attribute used for single table inheritance to this class name if this is not the
ActiveRecord::Base descendant.
Considering the hierarchy Reply < Message < ActiveRecord::Base, this makes it possible to
do Reply.new without having to set <tt>Reply[Reply.inheritance_column] = "Reply"</tt> yourself.
No such attribute would be set for objects of the Message class in that example.
