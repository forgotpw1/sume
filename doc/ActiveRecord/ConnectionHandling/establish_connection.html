<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionHandling#establish_connection</h1>

Establishes the connection to the database. Accepts a hash as input where
the <tt>:adapter</tt> key must be specified with the name of a database adapter (in lower-case)
example for regular databases (MySQL, Postgresql, etc):

  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    :adapter  => "mysql",
    :host     => "localhost",
    :username => "myuser",
    :password => "mypass",
    :database => "somedatabase"
  )

Example for SQLite database:

  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    :adapter => "sqlite",
    :database  => "path/to/dbfile"
  )

Also accepts keys as strings (for parsing from YAML for example):

  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    "adapter" => "sqlite",
    "database"  => "path/to/dbfile"
  )

Or a URL:

  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    "postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
  )

The exceptions AdapterNotSpecified, AdapterNotFound and ArgumentError
may be returned on an error.
