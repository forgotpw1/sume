<h1>ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#none</h1>

Returns a chainable relation with zero records, specifically an
instance of the NullRelation class.

The returned NullRelation inherits from Relation and implements the
Null Object pattern so it is an object with defined null behavior:
it always returns an empty array of records and does not query the database.

Any subsequent condition chained to the returned relation will continue
generating an empty relation and will not fire any query to the database.

Used in cases where a method or scope could return zero records but the
result needs to be chainable.

For example:

  @posts = current_user.visible_posts.where(:name => params[:name])
  # => the visible_posts method is expected to return a chainable Relation

  def visible_posts
    case role
    when 'Country Manager'
      Post.where(:country => country)
    when 'Reviewer'
      Post.published
    when 'Bad User'
      Post.none # => returning [] instead breaks the previous code
    end
  end
