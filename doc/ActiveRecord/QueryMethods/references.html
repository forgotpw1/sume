<h1>ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#references</h1>

Used to indicate that an association is referenced by an SQL string, and should
therefore be JOINed in any query rather than loaded separately.

For example:

  User.includes(:posts).where("posts.name = 'foo'")
  # => Doesn't JOIN the posts table, resulting in an error.

  User.includes(:posts).where("posts.name = 'foo'").references(:posts)
  # => Query now knows the string references posts, so adds a JOIN
