<h1>ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#select</h1>

Works in two unique ways.

First: takes a block so it can be used just like Array#select.

  Model.scoped.select { |m| m.field == value }

This will build an array of objects from the database for the scope,
converting them into an array and iterating through them using Array#select.

Second: Modifies the SELECT statement for the query so that only certain
fields are retrieved:

  >> Model.select(:field)
  => [#<Model field:value>]

Although in the above example it looks as though this method returns an
array, it actually returns a relation object and can have other query
methods appended to it, such as the other methods in ActiveRecord::QueryMethods.

The argument to the method can also be an array of fields.

  >> Model.select([:field, :other_field, :and_one_more])
  => [#<Model field: "value", other_field: "value", and_one_more: "value">]

Accessing attributes of an object that do not have fields retrieved by a select
will throw <tt>ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError</tt>:

  >> Model.select(:field).first.other_field
  => ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError: missing attribute: other_field
