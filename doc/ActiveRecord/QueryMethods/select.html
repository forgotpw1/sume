<h1>ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#select</h1>


<p>Works in two unique ways.</p>

<p>First: takes a block so it can be used just like Array#select.</p>

<pre>Model.scoped.select { |m| m.field == value }</pre>

<p>This will build an array of objects from the database for the scope,
converting them into an array and iterating through them using
Array#select.</p>

<p>Second: Modifies the SELECT statement for the query so that only certain
fields are retrieved:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; Model.select(:field)
=&gt; [#&lt;Model field:value&gt;]</pre>

<p>Although in the above example it looks as though this method returns an
array, it actually returns a relation object and can have other query
methods appended to it, such as the other methods in
ActiveRecord::QueryMethods.</p>

<p>This method will also take multiple parameters:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; Model.select(:field, :other_field, :and_one_more)
=&gt; [#&lt;Model field: &quot;value&quot;, other_field: &quot;value&quot;, and_one_more: &quot;value&quot;&gt;]</pre>

<p>Any attributes that do not have fields retrieved by a select will return
`nil` when the getter method for that attribute is used:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; Model.select(:field).first.other_field
=&gt; nil</pre>
