<h1>ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#find</h1>


<p>Find operates with four different retrieval approaches:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Find by id - This can either be a specific id (1), a list of ids (1, 5, 6),
or an array of ids ([5, 6, 10]). If no record can be found for all of the
listed ids, then RecordNotFound will be raised.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Find first - This will return the first record matched by the options used.
These options can either be specific conditions or merely an order. If no
record can be matched, <tt>nil</tt> is returned. Use <tt>Model.find(:first,
*args)</tt> or its shortcut <tt>Model.first(*args)</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Find last - This will return the last record matched by the options used.
These options can either be specific conditions or merely an order. If no
record can be matched, <tt>nil</tt> is returned. Use <tt>Model.find(:last,
*args)</tt> or its shortcut <tt>Model.last(*args)</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Find all - This will return all the records matched by the options used. If
no records are found, an empty array is returned. Use <tt>Model.find(:all,
*args)</tt> or its shortcut <tt>Model.all(*args)</tt>.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>All approaches accept an options hash as their last parameter.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:conditions</tt> - An SQL fragment like "administrator = 1",
<tt>[&quot;user_name = ?&quot;, username]</tt>, or <tt>[&quot;user_name =
:user_name&quot;, { :user_name =&gt; user_name }]</tt>. See conditions in
the intro.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:order</tt> - An SQL fragment like "created_at DESC, name".</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:group</tt> - An attribute name by which the result should be grouped.
Uses the <tt>GROUP BY</tt> SQL-clause.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:having</tt> - Combined with <tt>:group</tt> this can be used to filter
the records that a <tt>GROUP BY</tt> returns. Uses the <tt>HAVING</tt>
SQL-clause.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:limit</tt> - An integer determining the limit on the number of rows
that should be returned.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:offset</tt> - An integer determining the offset from where the rows
should be fetched. So at 5, it would skip rows 0 through 4.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:joins</tt> - Either an SQL fragment for additional joins like "LEFT
JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = id" (rarely needed), named associations
in the same form used for the <tt>:include</tt> option, which will perform
an <tt>INNER JOIN</tt> on the associated table(s), or an array containing a
mixture of both strings and named associations. If the value is a string,
then the records will be returned read-only since they will have attributes
that do not correspond to the table's columns. Pass <tt>:readonly =&gt;
false</tt> to override.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:include</tt> - Names associations that should be loaded alongside. The
symbols named refer to already defined associations. See eager loading
under Associations.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:select</tt> - By default, this is "*" as in "SELECT * FROM", but can
be changed if you, for example, want to do a join but not include the
joined columns. Takes a string with the SELECT SQL fragment (e.g. "id,
name").</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:from</tt> - By default, this is the table name of the class, but can
be changed to an alternate table name (or even the name of a database
view).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:readonly</tt> - Mark the returned records read-only so they cannot be
saved or updated.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:lock</tt> - An SQL fragment like "FOR UPDATE" or "LOCK IN SHARE MODE".
<tt>:lock =&gt; true</tt> gives connection's default exclusive lock,
usually "FOR UPDATE".</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre data-language="ruby"># find by id
Person.find(1)       # returns the object for ID = 1
Person.find(1, 2, 6) # returns an array for objects with IDs in (1, 2, 6)
Person.find([7, 17]) # returns an array for objects with IDs in (7, 17)
Person.find([1])     # returns an array for the object with ID = 1
Person.where(&quot;administrator = 1&quot;).order(&quot;created_on DESC&quot;).find(1)</pre>

<p>Note that returned records may not be in the same order as the ids you
provide since database rows are unordered. Give an explicit <tt>:order</tt>
to ensure the results are sorted.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre data-language="ruby"># find first
Person.first # returns the first object fetched by SELECT * FROM people
Person.where([&quot;user_name = ?&quot;, user_name]).first
Person.where([&quot;user_name = :u&quot;, { :u =&gt; user_name }]).first
Person.order(&quot;created_on DESC&quot;).offset(5).first

# find last
Person.last # returns the last object fetched by SELECT * FROM people
Person.where([&quot;user_name = ?&quot;, user_name]).last
Person.order(&quot;created_on DESC&quot;).offset(5).last

# find all
Person.all # returns an array of objects for all the rows fetched by SELECT * FROM people
Person.where([&quot;category IN (?)&quot;, categories]).limit(50).all
Person.where({ :friends =&gt; [&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Steve&quot;, &quot;Fred&quot;] }).all
Person.offset(10).limit(10).all
Person.includes([:account, :friends]).all
Person.group(&quot;category&quot;).all</pre>

<p>Example for find with a lock: Imagine two concurrent transactions: each
will read <tt>person.visits == 2</tt>, add 1 to it, and save, resulting in
two saves of <tt>person.visits = 3</tt>.  By locking the row, the second
transaction has to wait until the first is finished; we get the expected
<tt>person.visits == 4</tt>.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">Person.transaction do
  person = Person.lock(true).find(1)
  person.visits += 1
  person.save!
end</pre>
