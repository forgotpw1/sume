<h1>ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#find</h1>

Find by id - This can either be a specific id (1), a list of ids (1, 5, 6), or an array of ids ([5, 6, 10]).
If no record can be found for all of the listed ids, then RecordNotFound will be raised. If the primary key
is an integer, find by id coerces its arguments using +to_i+.

==== Examples

  Person.find(1)       # returns the object for ID = 1
  Person.find("1")     # returns the object for ID = 1
  Person.find(1, 2, 6) # returns an array for objects with IDs in (1, 2, 6)
  Person.find([7, 17]) # returns an array for objects with IDs in (7, 17)
  Person.find([1])     # returns an array for the object with ID = 1
  Person.where("administrator = 1").order("created_on DESC").find(1)

Note that returned records may not be in the same order as the ids you
provide since database rows are unordered. Give an explicit <tt>order</tt>
to ensure the results are sorted.

==== Find with lock

Example for find with a lock: Imagine two concurrent transactions:
each will read <tt>person.visits == 2</tt>, add 1 to it, and save, resulting
in two saves of <tt>person.visits = 3</tt>. By locking the row, the second
transaction has to wait until the first is finished; we get the
expected <tt>person.visits == 4</tt>.

  Person.transaction do
    person = Person.lock(true).find(1)
    person.visits += 1
    person.save!
  end
