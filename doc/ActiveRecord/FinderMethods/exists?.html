<h1>ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#exists?</h1>

Returns true if a record exists in the table that matches the +id+ or
conditions given, or false otherwise. The argument can take five forms:

* Integer - Finds the record with this primary key.
* String - Finds the record with a primary key corresponding to this
  string (such as <tt>'5'</tt>).
* Array - Finds the record that matches these +find+-style conditions
  (such as <tt>['color = ?', 'red']</tt>).
* Hash - Finds the record that matches these +find+-style conditions
  (such as <tt>{:color => 'red'}</tt>).
* No args - Returns false if the table is empty, true otherwise.

For more information about specifying conditions as a Hash or Array,
see the Conditions section in the introduction to ActiveRecord::Base.

Note: You can't pass in a condition as a string (like <tt>name =
'Jamie'</tt>), since it would be sanitized and then queried against
the primary key column, like <tt>id = 'name = \'Jamie\''</tt>.

==== Examples
  Person.exists?(5)
  Person.exists?('5')
  Person.exists?(:name => "David")
  Person.exists?(['name LIKE ?', "%#{query}%"])
  Person.exists?
