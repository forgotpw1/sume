<h1>ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#take</h1>

Gives a record (or N records if a parameter is supplied) without any implied
order. The order will depend on the database implementation.
If an order is supplied it will be respected.

Examples:

  Person.take # returns an object fetched by SELECT * FROM people
  Person.take(5) # returns 5 objects fetched by SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 5
  Person.where(["name LIKE '%?'", name]).take
