<h1>ActiveRecord::DynamicMatchers#respond_to?</h1>

This code in this file seems to have a lot of indirection, but the indirection
is there to provide extension points for the active_record_deprecated_finders
gem. When we stop supporting active_record_deprecated_finders (from Rails 5),
then we can remove the indirection.
