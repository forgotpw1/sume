ActiveRecord::Transactions::ClassMethods.transaction uses this exception
to distinguish a deliberate rollback from other exceptional situations.
Normally, raising an exception will cause the +transaction+ method to rollback
the database transaction *and* pass on the exception. But if you raise an
ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, then the database transaction will be rolled back,
without passing on the exception.

For example, you could do this in your controller to rollback a transaction:

  class BooksController < ActionController::Base
    def create
      Book.transaction do
        book = Book.new(params[:book])
        book.save!
        if today_is_friday?
          # The system must fail on Friday so that our support department
          # won't be out of job. We silently rollback this transaction
          # without telling the user.
          raise ActiveRecord::Rollback, "Call tech support!"
        end
      end
      # ActiveRecord::Rollback is the only exception that won't be passed on
      # by ActiveRecord::Base.transaction, so this line will still be reached
      # even on Friday.
      redirect_to root_url
    end
  end
