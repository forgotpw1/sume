== What is Optimistic Locking

Optimistic locking allows multiple users to access the same record for edits, and assumes a minimum of
conflicts with the data. It does this by checking whether another process has made changes to a record since
it was opened, an <tt>ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError</tt> exception is thrown if that has occurred
and the update is ignored.

Check out <tt>ActiveRecord::Locking::Pessimistic</tt> for an alternative.

== Usage

Active Records support optimistic locking if the field +lock_version+ is present. Each update to the
record increments the +lock_version+ column and the locking facilities ensure that records instantiated twice
will let the last one saved raise a +StaleObjectError+ if the first was also updated. Example:

  p1 = Person.find(1)
  p2 = Person.find(1)

  p1.first_name = "Michael"
  p1.save

  p2.first_name = "should fail"
  p2.save # Raises a ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError

Optimistic locking will also check for stale data when objects are destroyed. Example:

  p1 = Person.find(1)
  p2 = Person.find(1)

  p1.first_name = "Michael"
  p1.save

  p2.destroy # Raises a ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError

You're then responsible for dealing with the conflict by rescuing the exception and either rolling back, merging,
or otherwise apply the business logic needed to resolve the conflict.

This locking mechanism will function inside a single Ruby process. To make it work across all
web requests, the recommended approach is to add +lock_version+ as a hidden field to your form.

This behavior can be turned off by setting <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.lock_optimistically = false</tt>.
To override the name of the +lock_version+ column, set the <tt>locking_column</tt> class attribute:

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    self.locking_column = :lock_person
  end
