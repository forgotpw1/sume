<h1>ActiveRecord::Aggregations::ClassMethods#composed_of</h1>


<p>Adds reader and writer methods for manipulating a value object:
<tt>composed_of :address</tt> adds <tt>address</tt> and
<tt>address=(new_address)</tt> methods.</p>

<p>Options are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:class_name</tt> - Specifies the class name of the association. Use it
only if that name can't be inferred from the part id. So <tt>composed_of
:address</tt> will by default be linked to the Address class, but if the
real class name is CompanyAddress, you'll have to specify it with this
option.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:mapping</tt> - Specifies the mapping of entity attributes to
attributes of the value object. Each mapping is represented as an array
where the first item is the name of the entity attribute and the second
item is the name the attribute in the value object. The order in which
mappings are defined determine the order in which attributes are sent to
the value class constructor.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:allow_nil</tt> - Specifies that the value object will not be
instantiated when all mapped attributes are <tt>nil</tt>.  Setting the
value object to <tt>nil</tt> has the effect of writing <tt>nil</tt> to all
mapped attributes. This defaults to <tt>false</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:constructor</tt> - A symbol specifying the name of the constructor
method or a Proc that is called to initialize the value object. The
constructor is passed all of the mapped attributes, in the order that they
are defined in the <tt>:mapping option</tt>, as arguments and uses them to
instantiate a <tt>:class_name</tt> object. The default is <tt>:new</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:converter</tt> - A symbol specifying the name of a class method of
<tt>:class_name</tt> or a Proc that is called when a new value is assigned
to the value object. The converter is passed the single value that is used
in the assignment and is only called if the new value is not an instance of
<tt>:class_name</tt>.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Option examples:</p>

<pre>composed_of :temperature, :mapping =&gt; %w(reading celsius)
composed_of :balance, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Money&quot;, :mapping =&gt; %w(balance amount), :converter =&gt; Proc.new { |balance| balance.to_money }
composed_of :address, :mapping =&gt; [ %w(address_street street), %w(address_city city) ]
composed_of :gps_location
composed_of :gps_location, :allow_nil =&gt; true
composed_of :ip_address,
            :class_name =&gt; 'IPAddr',
            :mapping =&gt; %w(ip to_i),
            :constructor =&gt; Proc.new { |ip| IPAddr.new(ip, Socket::AF_INET) },
            :converter =&gt; Proc.new { |ip| ip.is_a?(Integer) ? IPAddr.new(ip, Socket::AF_INET) : IPAddr.new(ip.to_s) }</pre>
