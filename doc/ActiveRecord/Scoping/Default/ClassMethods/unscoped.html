<h1>ActiveRecord::Scoping::Default::ClassMethods#unscoped</h1>

Returns a scope for the model without the default_scope.

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    def self.default_scope
      where :published => true
    end
  end

  Post.all          # Fires "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE published = true"
  Post.unscoped.all # Fires "SELECT * FROM posts"

This method also accepts a block. All queries inside the block will
not use the default_scope:

  Post.unscoped {
    Post.limit(10) # Fires "SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 10"
  }

It is recommended that you use the block form of unscoped because chaining
unscoped with <tt>scope</tt> does not work.  Assuming that
<tt>published</tt> is a <tt>scope</tt>, the following two statements
are equal: the default_scope is applied on both.

  Post.unscoped.published
  Post.published
