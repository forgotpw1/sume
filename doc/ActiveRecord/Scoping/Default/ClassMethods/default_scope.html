<h1>ActiveRecord::Scoping::Default::ClassMethods#default_scope</h1>

Use this macro in your model to set a default scope for all operations on
the model.

  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    default_scope { where(:published => true) }
  end

  Article.all # => SELECT * FROM articles WHERE published = true

The <tt>default_scope</tt> is also applied while creating/building a record. It is not
applied while updating a record.

  Article.new.published    # => true
  Article.create.published # => true

(You can also pass any object which responds to <tt>call</tt> to the <tt>default_scope</tt>
macro, and it will be called when building the default scope.)

If you use multiple <tt>default_scope</tt> declarations in your model then they will
be merged together:

  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    default_scope { where(:published => true) }
    default_scope { where(:rating => 'G') }
  end

  Article.all # => SELECT * FROM articles WHERE published = true AND rating = 'G'

This is also the case with inheritance and module includes where the parent or module
defines a <tt>default_scope</tt> and the child or including class defines a second one.

If you need to do more complex things with a default scope, you can alternatively
define it as a class method:

  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    def self.default_scope
      # Should return a scope, you can call 'super' here etc.
    end
  end
