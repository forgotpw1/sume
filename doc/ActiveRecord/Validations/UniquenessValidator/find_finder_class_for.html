<h1>ActiveRecord::Validations::UniquenessValidator#find_finder_class_for</h1>


<p>The check for an existing value should be run from a class that isn't
abstract. This means working down from the current class (self), to the
first non-abstract class. Since classes don't know their subclasses, we
have to build the hierarchy between self and the record's class.</p>
