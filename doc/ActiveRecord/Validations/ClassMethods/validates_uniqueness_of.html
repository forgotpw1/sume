<h1>ActiveRecord::Validations::ClassMethods#validates_uniqueness_of</h1>


<p>Validates whether the value of the specified attributes are unique across
the system. Useful for making sure that only one user can be named
"davidhh".</p>

<pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_uniqueness_of :user_name
end</pre>

<p>It can also validate whether the value of the specified attributes are
unique based on a scope parameter:</p>

<pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_uniqueness_of :user_name, :scope =&gt; :account_id
end</pre>

<p>Or even multiple scope parameters.  For example, making sure that a teacher
can only be on the schedule once per semester for a particular class.</p>

<pre>class TeacherSchedule &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_uniqueness_of :teacher_id, :scope =&gt; [:semester_id, :class_id]
end</pre>

<p>When the record is created, a check is performed to make sure that no
record exists in the database with the given value for the specified
attribute (that maps to a column). When the record is updated, the same
check is made but disregarding the record itself.</p>

<p>Configuration options:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:message</tt> - Specifies a custom error message (default is: "has
already been taken").</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:scope</tt> - One or more columns by which to limit the scope of the
uniqueness constraint.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:case_sensitive</tt> - Looks for an exact match. Ignored by non-text
columns (<tt>true</tt> by default).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:allow_nil</tt> - If set to true, skips this validation if the
attribute is <tt>nil</tt> (default is <tt>false</tt>).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:allow_blank</tt> - If set to true, skips this validation if the
attribute is blank (default is <tt>false</tt>).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:if</tt> - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine if
the validation should occur (e.g. <tt>:if =&gt; :allow_validation</tt>, or
<tt>:if =&gt; Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step &gt; 2 }</tt>). The
method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:unless</tt> - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine
if the validation should not occur (e.g. <tt>:unless =&gt;
:skip_validation</tt>, or <tt>:unless =&gt; Proc.new { |user|
user.signup_step &lt;= 2 }</tt>).  The method, proc or string should return
or evaluate to a true or false value.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Concurrency and integrity</h3>

<p>Using this validation method in conjunction with ActiveRecord::Base#save
does not guarantee the absence of duplicate record insertions, because
uniqueness checks on the application level are inherently prone to race
conditions. For example, suppose that two users try to post a Comment at
the same time, and a Comment's title must be unique. At the database-level,
the actions performed by these users could be interleaved in the following
manner:</p>

<pre>             User 1                 |               User 2
------------------------------------+--------------------------------------
# User 1 checks whether there's     |
# already a comment with the title  |
# 'My Post'. This is not the case.  |
SELECT * FROM comments              |
WHERE title = 'My Post'             |
                                    |
                                    | # User 2 does the same thing and also
                                    | # infers that his title is unique.
                                    | SELECT * FROM comments
                                    | WHERE title = 'My Post'
                                    |
# User 1 inserts his comment.       |
INSERT INTO comments                |
(title, content) VALUES             |
('My Post', 'hi!')                  |
                                    |
                                    | # User 2 does the same thing.
                                    | INSERT INTO comments
                                    | (title, content) VALUES
                                    | ('My Post', 'hello!')
                                    |
                                    | # ^^^^^^
                                    | # Boom! We now have a duplicate
                                    | # title!</pre>

<p>This could even happen if you use transactions with the 'serializable'
isolation level. The best way to work around this problem is to add a
unique index to the database table using
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SchemaStatements#add_index. In the rare
case that a race condition occurs, the database will guarantee the field's
uniqueness.</p>

<p>When the database catches such a duplicate insertion,
ActiveRecord::Base#save will raise an ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid
exception. You can either choose to let this error propagate (which will
result in the default Rails exception page being shown), or you can catch
it and restart the transaction (e.g. by telling the user that the title
already exists, and asking him to re-enter the title). This technique is
also known as optimistic concurrency control: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control</a></p>

<p>The bundled ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters distinguish unique index
constraint errors from other types of database errors by throwing an
ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique exception. For other adapters you will have
to parse the (database-specific) exception message to detect such a case.
The following bundled adapters throw the ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique
exception:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::MysqlAdapter</p>
</li><li>
<p>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Mysql2Adapter</p>
</li><li>
<p>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLiteAdapter</p>
</li><li>
<p>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter</p>
</li><li>
<p>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter</p>
</li></ul>
