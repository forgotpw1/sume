<h1>ActiveRecord::Migration::CommandRecorder#inverse</h1>

Returns a list that represents commands that are the inverse of the
commands stored in +commands+. For example:

  recorder.record(:rename_table, [:old, :new])
  recorder.inverse # => [:rename_table, [:new, :old]]

This method will raise an +IrreversibleMigration+ exception if it cannot
invert the +commands+.
