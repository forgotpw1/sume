= Active Record Dynamic Scope Match

Provides dynamic attribute-based scopes such as <tt>scoped_by_price(4.99)</tt>
if, for example, the <tt>Product</tt> has an attribute with that name. You can
chain more <tt>scoped_by_* </tt> methods after the other. It acts like a named
scope except that it's dynamic.
