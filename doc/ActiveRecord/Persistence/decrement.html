<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#decrement</h1>


<p>Initializes <tt>attribute</tt> to zero if <tt>nil</tt> and subtracts the
value passed as <tt>by</tt> (default is 1). The decrement is performed
directly on the underlying attribute, no setter is invoked. Only makes
sense for number-based attributes. Returns <tt>self</tt>.</p>
