<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#attributes_from_column_definition</h1>


<p>Initializes the attributes array with keys matching the columns from the
linked table and the values matching the corresponding default value of
that column, so that a new instance, or one populated from a passed-in
Hash, still has all the attributes that instances loaded from the database
would.</p>
