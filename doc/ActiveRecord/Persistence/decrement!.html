<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#decrement!</h1>


<p>Wrapper around <tt>decrement</tt> that saves the record. This method
differs from its non-bang version in that it passes through the attribute
setter. Saving is not subjected to validation checks. Returns <tt>true</tt>
if the record could be saved.</p>
