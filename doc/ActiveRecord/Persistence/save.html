<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#save</h1>

Saves the model.

If the model is new a record gets created in the database, otherwise
the existing record gets updated.

By default, save always run validations. If any of them fail the action
is cancelled and +save+ returns +false+. However, if you supply
:validate => false, validations are bypassed altogether. See
ActiveRecord::Validations for more information.

There's a series of callbacks associated with +save+. If any of the
<tt>before_*</tt> callbacks return +false+ the action is cancelled and
+save+ returns +false+. See ActiveRecord::Callbacks for further
details.
