<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#save</h1>


<p>Saves the model.</p>

<p>If the model is new a record gets created in the database, otherwise the
existing record gets updated.</p>

<p>By default, save always run validations. If any of them fail the action is
cancelled and <tt>save</tt> returns <tt>false</tt>. However, if you supply
:validate =&gt; false, validations are bypassed altogether. See
ActiveRecord::Validations for more information.</p>

<p>There's a series of callbacks associated with <tt>save</tt>. If any of the
<tt>before_*</tt> callbacks return <tt>false</tt> the action is cancelled
and <tt>save</tt> returns <tt>false</tt>. See ActiveRecord::Callbacks for
further details.</p>
