<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#update_attributes</h1>

Updates the attributes of the model from the passed-in hash and saves the
record, all wrapped in a transaction. If the object is invalid, the saving
will fail and false will be returned.

When updating model attributes, mass-assignment security protection is respected.
If no +:as+ option is supplied then the +:default+ role will be used.
If you want to bypass the protection given by +attr_protected+ and
+attr_accessible+ then you can do so using the +:without_protection+ option.
