<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#becomes</h1>

Returns an instance of the specified +klass+ with the attributes of the
current record. This is mostly useful in relation to single-table
inheritance structures where you want a subclass to appear as the
superclass. This can be used along with record identification in
Action Pack to allow, say, <tt>Client < Company</tt> to do something
like render <tt>:partial => @client.becomes(Company)</tt> to render that
instance using the companies/company partial instead of clients/client.

Note: The new instance will share a link to the same attributes as the original class.
So any change to the attributes in either instance will affect the other.
