<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#save!</h1>

Saves the model.

If the model is new a record gets created in the database, otherwise
the existing record gets updated.

With <tt>save!</tt> validations always run. If any of them fail
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid gets raised. See ActiveRecord::Validations
for more information.

There's a series of callbacks associated with <tt>save!</tt>. If any of
the <tt>before_*</tt> callbacks return +false+ the action is cancelled
and <tt>save!</tt> raises ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved. See
ActiveRecord::Callbacks for further details.
