<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#save!</h1>


<p>Saves the model.</p>

<p>If the model is new a record gets created in the database, otherwise the
existing record gets updated.</p>

<p>With <tt>save!</tt> validations always run. If any of them fail
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid gets raised. See ActiveRecord::Validations for
more information.</p>

<p>There's a series of callbacks associated with <tt>save!</tt>. If any of the
<tt>before_*</tt> callbacks return <tt>false</tt> the action is cancelled
and <tt>save!</tt> raises ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved. See
ActiveRecord::Callbacks for further details.</p>
