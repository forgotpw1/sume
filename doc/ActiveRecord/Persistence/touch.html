<h1>ActiveRecord::Persistence#touch</h1>

Saves the record with the updated_at/on attributes set to the current time.
Please note that no validation is performed and no callbacks are executed.
If an attribute name is passed, that attribute is updated along with
updated_at/on attributes.

  product.touch               # updates updated_at/on
  product.touch(:designed_at) # updates the designed_at attribute and updated_at/on

If used along with +belongs_to+ then +touch+ will invoke +touch+ method on associated object.

  class Brake < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :car, :touch => true
  end

  class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :corporation, :touch => true
  end

  # triggers @brake.car.touch and @brake.car.corporation.touch
  @brake.touch
