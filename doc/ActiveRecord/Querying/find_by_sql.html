<h1>ActiveRecord::Querying#find_by_sql</h1>

Executes a custom SQL query against your database and returns all the results. The results will
be returned as an array with columns requested encapsulated as attributes of the model you call
this method from. If you call <tt>Product.find_by_sql</tt> then the results will be returned in
a Product object with the attributes you specified in the SQL query.

If you call a complicated SQL query which spans multiple tables the columns specified by the
SELECT will be attributes of the model, whether or not they are columns of the corresponding
table.

The +sql+ parameter is a full SQL query as a string. It will be called as is, there will be
no database agnostic conversions performed. This should be a last resort because using, for example,
MySQL specific terms will lock you to using that particular database engine or require you to
change your call if you switch engines.

==== Examples
  # A simple SQL query spanning multiple tables
  Post.find_by_sql "SELECT p.title, c.author FROM posts p, comments c WHERE p.id = c.post_id"
  > [#<Post:0x36bff9c @attributes={"title"=>"Ruby Meetup", "first_name"=>"Quentin"}>, ...]

  # You can use the same string replacement techniques as you can with ActiveRecord#find
  Post.find_by_sql ["SELECT title FROM posts WHERE author = ? AND created > ?", author_id, start_date]
  > [#<Post:0x36bff9c @attributes={"title"=>"The Cheap Man Buys Twice"}>, ...]
