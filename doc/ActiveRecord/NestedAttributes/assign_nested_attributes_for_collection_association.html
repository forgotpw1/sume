<h1>ActiveRecord::NestedAttributes#assign_nested_attributes_for_collection_association</h1>

Assigns the given attributes to the collection association.

Hashes with an <tt>:id</tt> value matching an existing associated record
will update that record. Hashes without an <tt>:id</tt> value will build
a new record for the association. Hashes with a matching <tt>:id</tt>
value and a <tt>:_destroy</tt> key set to a truthy value will mark the
matched record for destruction.

For example:

  assign_nested_attributes_for_collection_association(:people, {
    '1' => { :id => '1', :name => 'Peter' },
    '2' => { :name => 'John' },
    '3' => { :id => '2', :_destroy => true }
  })

Will update the name of the Person with ID 1, build a new associated
person with the name `John', and mark the associated Person with ID 2
for destruction.

Also accepts an Array of attribute hashes:

  assign_nested_attributes_for_collection_association(:people, [
    { :id => '1', :name => 'Peter' },
    { :name => 'John' },
    { :id => '2', :_destroy => true }
  ])
