<h1>ActiveRecord::NestedAttributes::ClassMethods#accepts_nested_attributes_for</h1>

Defines an attributes writer for the specified association(s). If you
are using <tt>attr_protected</tt> or <tt>attr_accessible</tt>, then you
will need to add the attribute writer to the allowed list.

Supported options:
[:allow_destroy]
  If true, destroys any members from the attributes hash with a
  <tt>_destroy</tt> key and a value that evaluates to +true+
  (eg. 1, '1', true, or 'true'). This option is off by default.
[:reject_if]
  Allows you to specify a Proc or a Symbol pointing to a method
  that checks whether a record should be built for a certain attribute
  hash. The hash is passed to the supplied Proc or the method
  and it should return either +true+ or +false+. When no :reject_if
  is specified, a record will be built for all attribute hashes that
  do not have a <tt>_destroy</tt> value that evaluates to true.
  Passing <tt>:all_blank</tt> instead of a Proc will create a proc
  that will reject a record where all the attributes are blank excluding
  any value for _destroy.
[:limit]
  Allows you to specify the maximum number of the associated records that
  can be processed with the nested attributes. If the size of the
  nested attributes array exceeds the specified limit, NestedAttributes::TooManyRecords
  exception is raised. If omitted, any number associations can be processed.
  Note that the :limit option is only applicable to one-to-many associations.
[:update_only]
  For a one-to-one association, this option allows you to specify how
  nested attributes are to be used when an associated record already
  exists. In general, an existing record may either be updated with the
  new set of attribute values or be replaced by a wholly new record
  containing those values. By default the :update_only option is +false+
  and the nested attributes are used to update the existing record only
  if they include the record's <tt>:id</tt> value. Otherwise a new
  record will be instantiated and used to replace the existing one.
  However if the :update_only option is +true+, the nested attributes
  are used to update the record's attributes always, regardless of
  whether the <tt>:id</tt> is present. The option is ignored for collection
  associations.

Examples:
  # creates avatar_attributes=
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, :reject_if => proc { |attributes| attributes['name'].blank? }
  # creates avatar_attributes=
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, :reject_if => :all_blank
  # creates avatar_attributes= and posts_attributes=
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, :posts, :allow_destroy => true
