= Active Record Nested Attributes

Nested attributes allow you to save attributes on associated records
through the parent. By default nested attribute updating is turned off,
you can enable it using the accepts_nested_attributes_for class method.
When you enable nested attributes an attribute writer is defined on
the model.

The attribute writer is named after the association, which means that
in the following example, two new methods are added to your model:

<tt>author_attributes=(attributes)</tt> and
<tt>pages_attributes=(attributes)</tt>.

  class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :author
    has_many :pages

    accepts_nested_attributes_for :author, :pages
  end

Note that the <tt>:autosave</tt> option is automatically enabled on every
association that accepts_nested_attributes_for is used for.

=== One-to-one

Consider a Member model that has one Avatar:

  class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :avatar
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar
  end

Enabling nested attributes on a one-to-one association allows you to
create the member and avatar in one go:

  params = { :member => { :name => 'Jack', :avatar_attributes => { :icon => 'smiling' } } }
  member = Member.create(params[:member])
  member.avatar.id # => 2
  member.avatar.icon # => 'smiling'

It also allows you to update the avatar through the member:

  params = { :member => { :avatar_attributes => { :id => '2', :icon => 'sad' } } }
  member.update_attributes params[:member]
  member.avatar.icon # => 'sad'

By default you will only be able to set and update attributes on the
associated model. If you want to destroy the associated model through the
attributes hash, you have to enable it first using the
<tt>:allow_destroy</tt> option.

  class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :avatar
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, :allow_destroy => true
  end

Now, when you add the <tt>_destroy</tt> key to the attributes hash, with a
value that evaluates to +true+, you will destroy the associated model:

  member.avatar_attributes = { :id => '2', :_destroy => '1' }
  member.avatar.marked_for_destruction? # => true
  member.save
  member.reload.avatar # => nil

Note that the model will _not_ be destroyed until the parent is saved.

=== One-to-many

Consider a member that has a number of posts:

  class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts
  end

You can now set or update attributes on an associated post model through
the attribute hash.

For each hash that does _not_ have an <tt>id</tt> key a new record will
be instantiated, unless the hash also contains a <tt>_destroy</tt> key
that evaluates to +true+.

  params = { :member => {
    :name => 'joe', :posts_attributes => [
      { :title => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
      { :title => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen' },
      { :title => '', :_destroy => '1' } # this will be ignored
    ]
  }}

  member = Member.create(params['member'])
  member.posts.length # => 2
  member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
  member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen'

You may also set a :reject_if proc to silently ignore any new record
hashes if they fail to pass your criteria. For example, the previous
example could be rewritten as:

   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
     has_many :posts
     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :reject_if => proc { |attributes| attributes['title'].blank? }
   end

  params = { :member => {
    :name => 'joe', :posts_attributes => [
      { :title => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
      { :title => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen' },
      { :title => '' } # this will be ignored because of the :reject_if proc
    ]
  }}

  member = Member.create(params['member'])
  member.posts.length # => 2
  member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
  member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen'

Alternatively, :reject_if also accepts a symbol for using methods:

   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
     has_many :posts
     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :reject_if => :new_record?
   end

   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
     has_many :posts
     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :reject_if => :reject_posts

     def reject_posts(attributed)
       attributed['title'].blank?
     end
   end

If the hash contains an <tt>id</tt> key that matches an already
associated record, the matching record will be modified:

  member.attributes = {
    :name => 'Joe',
    :posts_attributes => [
      { :id => 1, :title => '[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
      { :id => 2, :title => '[UPDATED] other post' }
    ]
  }

  member.posts.first.title # => '[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
  member.posts.second.title # => '[UPDATED] other post'

By default the associated records are protected from being destroyed. If
you want to destroy any of the associated records through the attributes
hash, you have to enable it first using the <tt>:allow_destroy</tt>
option. This will allow you to also use the <tt>_destroy</tt> key to
destroy existing records:

  class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, :allow_destroy => true
  end

  params = { :member => {
    :posts_attributes => [{ :id => '2', :_destroy => '1' }]
  }}

  member.attributes = params['member']
  member.posts.detect { |p| p.id == 2 }.marked_for_destruction? # => true
  member.posts.length # => 2
  member.save
  member.reload.posts.length # => 1

=== Saving

All changes to models, including the destruction of those marked for
destruction, are saved and destroyed automatically and atomically when
the parent model is saved. This happens inside the transaction initiated
by the parents save method. See ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation.

=== Using with attr_accessible

The use of <tt>attr_accessible</tt> can interfere with nested attributes
if you're not careful. For example, if the <tt>Member</tt> model above
was using <tt>attr_accessible</tt> like this:

  attr_accessible :name

You would need to modify it to look like this:

  attr_accessible :name, :posts_attributes

=== Validating the presence of a parent model

If you want to validate that a child record is associated with a parent
record, you can use <tt>validates_presence_of</tt> and
<tt>inverse_of</tt> as this example illustrates:

  class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts, :inverse_of => :member
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts
  end

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :member, :inverse_of => :posts
    validates_presence_of :member
  end
