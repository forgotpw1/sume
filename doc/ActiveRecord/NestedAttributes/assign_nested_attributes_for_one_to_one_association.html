<h1>ActiveRecord::NestedAttributes#assign_nested_attributes_for_one_to_one_association</h1>

Assigns the given attributes to the association.

If an associated record does not yet exist, one will be instantiated. If
an associated record already exists, the method's behavior depends on
the value of the update_only option. If update_only is +false+ and the
given attributes include an <tt>:id</tt> that matches the existing record's
id, then the existing record will be modified. If no <tt>:id</tt> is provided
it will be replaced with a new record. If update_only is +true+ the existing
record will be modified regardless of whether an <tt>:id</tt> is provided.

If the given attributes include a matching <tt>:id</tt> attribute, or
update_only is true, and a <tt>:_destroy</tt> key set to a truthy value,
then the existing record will be marked for destruction.
