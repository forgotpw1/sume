<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#delete_all</h1>


<p>Deletes the records matching <tt>conditions</tt> without instantiating the
records first, and hence not calling the <tt>destroy</tt> method nor
invoking callbacks. This is a single SQL DELETE statement that goes
straight to the database, much more efficient than <tt>destroy_all</tt>. Be
careful with relations though, in particular <tt>:dependent</tt> rules
defined on associations are not honored.  Returns the number of rows
affected.</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>conditions</tt> - Conditions are specified the same way as with
<tt>find</tt> method.</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre data-language="ruby">Post.delete_all(&quot;person_id = 5 AND (category = 'Something' OR category = 'Else')&quot;)
Post.delete_all([&quot;person_id = ? AND (category = ? OR category = ?)&quot;, 5, 'Something', 'Else'])
Post.where(:person_id =&gt; 5).where(:category =&gt; ['Something', 'Else']).delete_all</pre>

<p>Both calls delete the affected posts all at once with a single DELETE
statement. If you need to destroy dependent associations or call your
<tt>before_*</tt> or <tt>after_destroy</tt> callbacks, use the
<tt>destroy_all</tt> method instead.</p>
