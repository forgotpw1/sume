<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#delete_all</h1>

Deletes the records matching +conditions+ without instantiating the records
first, and hence not calling the +destroy+ method nor invoking callbacks. This
is a single SQL DELETE statement that goes straight to the database, much more
efficient than +destroy_all+. Be careful with relations though, in particular
<tt>:dependent</tt> rules defined on associations are not honored. Returns the
number of rows affected.

  Post.delete_all("person_id = 5 AND (category = 'Something' OR category = 'Else')")
  Post.delete_all(["person_id = ? AND (category = ? OR category = ?)", 5, 'Something', 'Else'])
  Post.where(:person_id => 5).where(:category => ['Something', 'Else']).delete_all

Both calls delete the affected posts all at once with a single DELETE statement.
If you need to destroy dependent associations or call your <tt>before_*</tt> or
+after_destroy+ callbacks, use the +destroy_all+ method instead.

If a limit scope is supplied, +delete_all+ raises an ActiveRecord error:

  Post.limit(100).delete_all
  # => ActiveRecord::ActiveRecordError: delete_all doesn't support limit scope
