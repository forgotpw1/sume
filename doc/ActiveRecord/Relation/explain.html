<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#explain</h1>

Runs EXPLAIN on the query or queries triggered by this relation and
returns the result as a string. The string is formatted imitating the
ones printed by the database shell.

Note that this method actually runs the queries, since the results of some
are needed by the next ones when eager loading is going on.

Please see further details in the
{Active Record Query Interface guide}[http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#running-explain].
