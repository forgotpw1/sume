<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#destroy_all</h1>


<p>Destroys the records matching <tt>conditions</tt> by instantiating each
record and calling its <tt>destroy</tt> method. Each object's callbacks are
executed (including <tt>:dependent</tt> association options and
<tt>before_destroy</tt>/<tt>after_destroy</tt> Observer methods). Returns
the collection of objects that were destroyed; each will be frozen, to
reflect that no changes should be made (since they can't be persisted).</p>

<p>Note: Instantiation, callback execution, and deletion of each record can be
time consuming when you're removing many records at once. It generates at
least one SQL <tt>DELETE</tt> query per record (or possibly more, to
enforce your callbacks). If you want to delete many rows quickly, without
concern for their associations or callbacks, use <tt>delete_all</tt>
instead.</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>conditions</tt> - A string, array, or hash that specifies which records
to destroy. If omitted, all records are destroyed. See the Conditions
section in the introduction to ActiveRecord::Base for more information.</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre data-language="ruby">Person.destroy_all(&quot;last_login &lt; '2004-04-04'&quot;)
Person.destroy_all(:status =&gt; &quot;inactive&quot;)
Person.where(:age =&gt; 0..18).destroy_all</pre>
