<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#destroy_all</h1>

Destroys the records matching +conditions+ by instantiating each
record and calling its +destroy+ method. Each object's callbacks are
executed (including <tt>:dependent</tt> association options and
+before_destroy+/+after_destroy+ Observer methods). Returns the
collection of objects that were destroyed; each will be frozen, to
reflect that no changes should be made (since they can't be
persisted).

Note: Instantiation, callback execution, and deletion of each
record can be time consuming when you're removing many records at
once. It generates at least one SQL +DELETE+ query per record (or
possibly more, to enforce your callbacks). If you want to delete many
rows quickly, without concern for their associations or callbacks, use
+delete_all+ instead.

==== Parameters

* +conditions+ - A string, array, or hash that specifies which records
  to destroy. If omitted, all records are destroyed. See the
  Conditions section in the introduction to ActiveRecord::Base for
  more information.

==== Examples

  Person.destroy_all("last_login < '2004-04-04'")
  Person.destroy_all(:status => "inactive")
  Person.where(:age => 0..18).destroy_all
