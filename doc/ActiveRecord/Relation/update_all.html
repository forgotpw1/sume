<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#update_all</h1>


<p>Updates all records with details given if they match a set of conditions
supplied, limits and order can also be supplied. This method constructs a
single SQL UPDATE statement and sends it straight to the database. It does
not instantiate the involved models and it does not trigger Active Record
callbacks or validations.</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>updates</tt> - A string, array, or hash representing the SET part of an
SQL statement.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>conditions</tt> - A string, array, or hash representing the WHERE part
of an SQL statement. See conditions in the intro.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>options</tt> - Additional options are <tt>:limit</tt> and
<tt>:order</tt>, see the examples for usage.</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre># Update all customers with the given attributes
Customer.update_all :wants_email =&gt; true

# Update all books with 'Rails' in their title
Book.update_all &quot;author = 'David'&quot;, &quot;title LIKE '%Rails%'&quot;

# Update all avatars migrated more than a week ago
Avatar.update_all ['migrated_at = ?', Time.now.utc], ['migrated_at &gt; ?', 1.week.ago]

# Update all books that match conditions, but limit it to 5 ordered by date
Book.update_all &quot;author = 'David'&quot;, &quot;title LIKE '%Rails%'&quot;, :order =&gt; 'created_at', :limit =&gt; 5

# Conditions from the current relation also works
Book.where('title LIKE ?', '%Rails%').update_all(:author =&gt; 'David')

# The same idea applies to limit and order
Book.where('title LIKE ?', '%Rails%').order(:created_at).limit(5).update_all(:author =&gt; 'David')</pre>
