<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#destroy</h1>


<p>Destroy an object (or multiple objects) that has the given id, the object
is instantiated first, therefore all callbacks and filters are fired off
before the object is deleted.  This method is less efficient than
ActiveRecord#delete but allows cleanup methods and other actions to be run.</p>

<p>This essentially finds the object (or multiple objects) with the given id,
creates a new object from the attributes, and then calls destroy on it.</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>id</tt> - Can be either an Integer or an Array of Integers.</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre># Destroy a single object
Todo.destroy(1)

# Destroy multiple objects
todos = [1,2,3]
Todo.destroy(todos)</pre>
