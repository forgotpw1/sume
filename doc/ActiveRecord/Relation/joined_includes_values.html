<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#joined_includes_values</h1>

Joins that are also marked for preloading. In which case we should just eager load them.
Note that this is a naive implementation because we could have strings and symbols which
represent the same association, but that aren't matched by this. Also, we could have
nested hashes which partially match, e.g. { :a => :b } & { :a => [:b, :c] }
