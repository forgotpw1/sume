<h1>ActiveRecord::CounterCache#increment_counter</h1>

Increment a number field by one, usually representing a count.

This is used for caching aggregate values, so that they don't need to be computed every time.
For example, a DiscussionBoard may cache post_count and comment_count otherwise every time the board is
shown it would have to run an SQL query to find how many posts and comments there are.

==== Parameters

* +counter_name+ - The name of the field that should be incremented.
* +id+ - The id of the object that should be incremented.

==== Examples

  # Increment the post_count column for the record with an id of 5
  DiscussionBoard.increment_counter(:post_count, 5)
