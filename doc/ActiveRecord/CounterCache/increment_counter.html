<h1>ActiveRecord::CounterCache#increment_counter</h1>


<p>Increment a number field by one, usually representing a count.</p>

<p>This is used for caching aggregate values, so that they don't need to be
computed every time. For example, a DiscussionBoard may cache post_count
and comment_count otherwise every time the board is shown it would have to
run an SQL query to find how many posts and comments there are.</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>counter_name</tt> - The name of the field that should be incremented.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>id</tt> - The id of the object that should be incremented.</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre># Increment the post_count column for the record with an id of 5
DiscussionBoard.increment_counter(:post_count, 5)</pre>
