<h1>ActiveRecord::CounterCache#update_counters</h1>

A generic "counter updater" implementation, intended primarily to be
used by increment_counter and decrement_counter, but which may also
be useful on its own. It simply does a direct SQL update for the record
with the given ID, altering the given hash of counters by the amount
given by the corresponding value:

==== Parameters

* +id+ - The id of the object you wish to update a counter on or an Array of ids.
* +counters+ - An Array of Hashes containing the names of the fields
  to update as keys and the amount to update the field by as values.

==== Examples

  # For the Post with id of 5, decrement the comment_count by 1, and
  # increment the action_count by 1
  Post.update_counters 5, :comment_count => -1, :action_count => 1
  # Executes the following SQL:
  # UPDATE posts
  #    SET comment_count = COALESCE(comment_count, 0) - 1,
  #        action_count = COALESCE(action_count, 0) + 1
  #  WHERE id = 5

  # For the Posts with id of 10 and 15, increment the comment_count by 1
  Post.update_counters [10, 15], :comment_count => 1
  # Executes the following SQL:
  # UPDATE posts
  #    SET comment_count = COALESCE(comment_count, 0) + 1
  #  WHERE id IN (10, 15)
