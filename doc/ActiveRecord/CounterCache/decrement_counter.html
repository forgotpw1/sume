<h1>ActiveRecord::CounterCache#decrement_counter</h1>

Decrement a number field by one, usually representing a count.

This works the same as increment_counter but reduces the column value by 1 instead of increasing it.

==== Parameters

* +counter_name+ - The name of the field that should be decremented.
* +id+ - The id of the object that should be decremented.

==== Examples

  # Decrement the post_count column for the record with an id of 5
  DiscussionBoard.decrement_counter(:post_count, 5)
