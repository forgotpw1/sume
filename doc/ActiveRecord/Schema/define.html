<h1>ActiveRecord::Schema.define</h1>

Eval the given block. All methods available to the current connection
adapter are available within the block, so you can easily use the
database definition DSL to build up your schema (+create_table+,
+add_index+, etc.).

The +info+ hash is optional, and if given is used to define metadata
about the current schema (currently, only the schema's version):

  ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version => 20380119000001) do
    ...
  end
