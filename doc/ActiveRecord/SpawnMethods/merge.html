<h1>ActiveRecord::SpawnMethods#merge</h1>

Merges in the conditions from <tt>other</tt>, if <tt>other</tt> is an <tt>ActiveRecord::Relation</tt>.
Returns an array representing the intersection of the resulting records with <tt>other</tt>, if <tt>other</tt> is an array.

==== Examples

  Post.where(:published => true).joins(:comments).merge( Comment.where(:spam => false) )
  # Performs a single join query with both where conditions.

  recent_posts = Post.order('created_at DESC').first(5)
  Post.where(:published => true).merge(recent_posts)
  # Returns the intersection of all published posts with the 5 most recently created posts.
  # (This is just an example. You'd probably want to do this with a single query!)
