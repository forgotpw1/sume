= Active Record Validations

Active Record includes the majority of its validations from <tt>ActiveModel::Validations</tt>
all of which accept the <tt>:on</tt> argument to define the context where the
validations are active. Active Record will always supply either the context of
<tt>:create</tt> or <tt>:update</tt> dependent on whether the model is a
<tt>new_record?</tt>.
