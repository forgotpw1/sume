<h1>ActiveRecord::Explain#silence_auto_explain</h1>

Silences automatic EXPLAIN logging for the duration of the block.

This has high priority, no EXPLAINs will be run even if downwards
the threshold is set to 0.

As the name of the method suggests this only applies to automatic
EXPLAINs, manual calls to <tt>ActiveRecord::Relation#explain</tt> run.
