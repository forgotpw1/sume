<h1>Numeric#second</h1>


<p>Enables the use of time calculations and declarations, like 45.minutes +
2.hours + 4.years.</p>

<p>These methods use Time#advance for precise date calculations when using
from_now, ago, etc. as well as adding or subtracting their results from a
Time object. For example:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby"># equivalent to Time.now.advance(:months =&gt; 1)
1.month.from_now

# equivalent to Time.now.advance(:years =&gt; 2)
2.years.from_now

# equivalent to Time.now.advance(:months =&gt; 4, :years =&gt; 5)
(4.months + 5.years).from_now</pre>

<p>While these methods provide precise calculation when used as in the
examples above, care should be taken to note that this is not true if the
result of `months', `years', etc is converted before use:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby"># equivalent to 30.days.to_i.from_now
1.month.to_i.from_now

# equivalent to 365.25.days.to_f.from_now
1.year.to_f.from_now</pre>

<p>In such cases, Ruby's core <a
href="http://stdlib.rubyonrails.org/libdoc/date/rdoc/index.html">Date</a>
and <a
href="http://stdlib.rubyonrails.org/libdoc/time/rdoc/index.html">Time</a>
should be used for precision date and time arithmetic</p>
