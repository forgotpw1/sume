<h1>ActionMailer::TestHelper#assert_no_emails</h1>

Assert that no emails have been sent.

  def test_emails
    assert_no_emails
    ContactMailer.deliver_contact
    assert_emails 1
  end

If a block is passed, that block should not cause any emails to be sent.

  def test_emails_again
    assert_no_emails do
      # No emails should be sent from this block
    end
  end

Note: This assertion is simply a shortcut for:

  assert_emails 0
