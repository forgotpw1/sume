Action Mailer allows you to send email from your application using a mailer model and views.

= Mailer Models

To use Action Mailer, you need to create a mailer model.

  $ rails generate mailer Notifier

The generated model inherits from <tt>ActionMailer::Base</tt>. A mailer model defines methods
used to generate an email message. In these methods, you can setup variables to be used in
the mailer views, options on the mail itself such as the <tt>:from</tt> address, and attachments.

Examples:

  class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
    default :from => 'no-reply@example.com',
            :return_path => 'system@example.com'

    def welcome(recipient)
      @account = recipient
      mail(:to => recipient.email_address_with_name,
           :bcc => ["bcc@example.com", "Order Watcher <watcher@example.com>"])
    end
  end

Within the mailer method, you have access to the following methods:

* <tt>attachments[]=</tt> - Allows you to add attachments to your email in an intuitive
  manner; <tt>attachments['filename.png'] = File.read('path/to/filename.png')</tt>

* <tt>attachments.inline[]=</tt> - Allows you to add an inline attachment to your email
  in the same manner as <tt>attachments[]=</tt>

* <tt>headers[]=</tt> - Allows you to specify any header field in your email such
  as <tt>headers['X-No-Spam'] = 'True'</tt>. Note, while most fields like <tt>To:</tt>
  <tt>From:</tt> can only appear once in an email header, other fields like <tt>X-Anything</tt>
  can appear multiple times. If you want to change a field that can appear multiple times,
  you need to set it to nil first so that Mail knows you are replacing it and not adding
  another field of the same name.

* <tt>headers(hash)</tt> - Allows you to specify multiple headers in your email such
  as <tt>headers({'X-No-Spam' => 'True', 'In-Reply-To' => '1234@message.id'})</tt>

* <tt>mail</tt> - Allows you to specify email to be sent.

The hash passed to the mail method allows you to specify any header that a Mail::Message
will accept (any valid Email header including optional fields).

The mail method, if not passed a block, will inspect your views and send all the views with
the same name as the method, so the above action would send the +welcome.text.erb+ view
file as well as the +welcome.text.html.erb+ view file in a +multipart/alternative+ email.

If you want to explicitly render only certain templates, pass a block:

  mail(:to => user.email) do |format|
    format.text
    format.html
  end

The block syntax is also useful in providing information specific to a part:

  mail(:to => user.email) do |format|
    format.text(:content_transfer_encoding => "base64")
    format.html
  end

Or even to render a special view:

  mail(:to => user.email) do |format|
    format.text
    format.html { render "some_other_template" }
  end

= Mailer views

Like Action Controller, each mailer class has a corresponding view directory in which each
method of the class looks for a template with its name.

To define a template to be used with a mailing, create an <tt>.erb</tt> file with the same
name as the method in your mailer model. For example, in the mailer defined above, the template at
<tt>app/views/notifier/welcome.text.erb</tt> would be used to generate the email.

Variables defined in the model are accessible as instance variables in the view.

Emails by default are sent in plain text, so a sample view for our model example might look like this:

  Hi <%= @account.name %>,
  Thanks for joining our service! Please check back often.

You can even use Action Pack helpers in these views. For example:

  You got a new note!
  <%= truncate(@note.body, :length => 25) %>

If you need to access the subject, from or the recipients in the view, you can do that through message object:

  You got a new note from <%= message.from %>!
  <%= truncate(@note.body, :length => 25) %>


= Generating URLs

URLs can be generated in mailer views using <tt>url_for</tt> or named routes. Unlike controllers from
Action Pack, the mailer instance doesn't have any context about the incoming request, so you'll need
to provide all of the details needed to generate a URL.

When using <tt>url_for</tt> you'll need to provide the <tt>:host</tt>, <tt>:controller</tt>, and <tt>:action</tt>:

  <%= url_for(:host => "example.com", :controller => "welcome", :action => "greeting") %>

When using named routes you only need to supply the <tt>:host</tt>:

  <%= users_url(:host => "example.com") %>

You should use the <tt>named_route_url</tt> style (which generates absolute URLs) and avoid using the
<tt>named_route_path</tt> style (which generates relative URLs), since clients reading the mail will
have no concept of a current URL from which to determine a relative path.

It is also possible to set a default host that will be used in all mailers by setting the <tt>:host</tt>
option as a configuration option in <tt>config/application.rb</tt>:

  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "example.com" }

When you decide to set a default <tt>:host</tt> for your mailers, then you need to make sure to use the
<tt>:only_path => false</tt> option when using <tt>url_for</tt>. Since the <tt>url_for</tt> view helper
will generate relative URLs by default when a <tt>:host</tt> option isn't explicitly provided, passing
<tt>:only_path => false</tt> will ensure that absolute URLs are generated.

= Sending mail

Once a mailer action and template are defined, you can deliver your message or create it and save it
for delivery later:

  Notifier.welcome(david).deliver # sends the email
  mail = Notifier.welcome(david)  # => a Mail::Message object
  mail.deliver                    # sends the email

You never instantiate your mailer class. Rather, you just call the method you defined on the class itself.

= Multipart Emails

Multipart messages can also be used implicitly because Action Mailer will automatically detect and use
multipart templates, where each template is named after the name of the action, followed by the content
type. Each such detected template will be added as a separate part to the message.

For example, if the following templates exist:
* signup_notification.text.erb
* signup_notification.text.html.erb
* signup_notification.text.xml.builder
* signup_notification.text.yaml.erb

Each would be rendered and added as a separate part to the message, with the corresponding content
type. The content type for the entire message is automatically set to <tt>multipart/alternative</tt>,
which indicates that the email contains multiple different representations of the same email
body. The same instance variables defined in the action are passed to all email templates.

Implicit template rendering is not performed if any attachments or parts have been added to the email.
This means that you'll have to manually add each part to the email and set the content type of the email
to <tt>multipart/alternative</tt>.

= Attachments

Sending attachment in emails is easy:

  class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
    def welcome(recipient)
      attachments['free_book.pdf'] = File.read('path/to/file.pdf')
      mail(:to => recipient, :subject => "New account information")
    end
  end

Which will (if it had both a <tt>welcome.text.erb</tt> and <tt>welcome.text.html.erb</tt>
template in the view directory), send a complete <tt>multipart/mixed</tt> email with two parts,
the first part being a <tt>multipart/alternative</tt> with the text and HTML email parts inside,
and the second being a <tt>application/pdf</tt> with a Base64 encoded copy of the file.pdf book
with the filename +free_book.pdf+.

= Inline Attachments

You can also specify that a file should be displayed inline with other HTML. This is useful
if you want to display a corporate logo or a photo.

  class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
    def welcome(recipient)
      attachments.inline['photo.png'] = File.read('path/to/photo.png')
      mail(:to => recipient, :subject => "Here is what we look like")
    end
  end

And then to reference the image in the view, you create a <tt>welcome.html.erb</tt> file and
make a call to +image_tag+ passing in the attachment you want to display and then call
+url+ on the attachment to get the relative content id path for the image source:

  <h1>Please Don't Cringe</h1>

  <%= image_tag attachments['photo.png'].url -%>

As we are using Action View's +image_tag+ method, you can pass in any other options you want:

  <h1>Please Don't Cringe</h1>

  <%= image_tag attachments['photo.png'].url, :alt => 'Our Photo', :class => 'photo' -%>

= Observing and Intercepting Mails

Action Mailer provides hooks into the Mail observer and interceptor methods. These allow you to
register classes that are called during the mail delivery life cycle.

An observer class must implement the <tt>:delivered_email(message)</tt> method which will be
called once for every email sent after the email has been sent.

An interceptor class must implement the <tt>:delivering_email(message)</tt> method which will be
called before the email is sent, allowing you to make modifications to the email before it hits
the delivery agents. Your class should make any needed modifications directly to the passed
in Mail::Message instance.

= Default Hash

Action Mailer provides some intelligent defaults for your emails, these are usually specified in a
default method inside the class definition:

  class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
    default :sender => 'system@example.com'
  end

You can pass in any header value that a <tt>Mail::Message</tt> accepts. Out of the box,
<tt>ActionMailer::Base</tt> sets the following:

* <tt>:mime_version => "1.0"</tt>
* <tt>:charset      => "UTF-8",</tt>
* <tt>:content_type => "text/plain",</tt>
* <tt>:parts_order  => [ "text/plain", "text/enriched", "text/html" ]</tt>

<tt>parts_order</tt> and <tt>charset</tt> are not actually valid <tt>Mail::Message</tt> header fields,
but Action Mailer translates them appropriately and sets the correct values.

As you can pass in any header, you need to either quote the header as a string, or pass it in as
an underscored symbol, so the following will work:

  class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
    default 'Content-Transfer-Encoding' => '7bit',
            :content_description => 'This is a description'
  end

Finally, Action Mailer also supports passing <tt>Proc</tt> objects into the default hash, so you
can define methods that evaluate as the message is being generated:

  class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
    default 'X-Special-Header' => Proc.new { my_method }

    private

      def my_method
        'some complex call'
      end
  end

Note that the proc is evaluated right at the start of the mail message generation, so if you
set something in the defaults using a proc, and then set the same thing inside of your
mailer method, it will get over written by the mailer method.

= Callbacks

You can specify callbacks using before_filter and after_filter for configuring your messages.
This may be useful, for example, when you want to add default inline attachments for all
messages sent out by a certain mailer class:

  class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
    before_filter :add_inline_attachment!

    def welcome
      mail
    end

    private

      def add_inline_attachment!
        attachments.inline["footer.jpg"] = File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg')
      end
  end

Callbacks in ActionMailer are implemented using AbstractController::Callbacks, so you
can define and configure callbacks in the same manner that you would use callbacks in
classes that inherit from ActionController::Base.

Note that unless you have a specific reason to do so, you should prefer using before_filter
rather than after_filter in your ActionMailer classes so that headers are parsed properly.

= Configuration options

These options are specified on the class level, like
<tt>ActionMailer::Base.raise_delivery_errors = true</tt>

* <tt>default</tt> - You can pass this in at a class level as well as within the class itself as
  per the above section.

* <tt>logger</tt> - the logger is used for generating information on the mailing run if available.
  Can be set to nil for no logging. Compatible with both Ruby's own Logger and Log4r loggers.

* <tt>smtp_settings</tt> - Allows detailed configuration for <tt>:smtp</tt> delivery method:
  * <tt>:address</tt> - Allows you to use a remote mail server. Just change it from its default
    "localhost" setting.
  * <tt>:port</tt> - On the off chance that your mail server doesn't run on port 25, you can change it.
  * <tt>:domain</tt> - If you need to specify a HELO domain, you can do it here.
  * <tt>:user_name</tt> - If your mail server requires authentication, set the username in this setting.
  * <tt>:password</tt> - If your mail server requires authentication, set the password in this setting.
  * <tt>:authentication</tt> - If your mail server requires authentication, you need to specify the
    authentication type here.
    This is a symbol and one of <tt>:plain</tt> (will send the password in the clear), <tt>:login</tt> (will
    send password Base64 encoded) or <tt>:cram_md5</tt> (combines a Challenge/Response mechanism to exchange
    information and a cryptographic Message Digest 5 algorithm to hash important information)
  * <tt>:enable_starttls_auto</tt> - When set to true, detects if STARTTLS is enabled in your SMTP server
    and starts to use it.
  * <tt>:openssl_verify_mode</tt> - When using TLS, you can set how OpenSSL checks the certificate. This is
    really useful if you need to validate a self-signed and/or a wildcard certificate. You can use the name
    of an OpenSSL verify constant ('none', 'peer', 'client_once','fail_if_no_peer_cert') or directly the
    constant  (OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE, OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER,...).

* <tt>sendmail_settings</tt> - Allows you to override options for the <tt>:sendmail</tt> delivery method.
  * <tt>:location</tt> - The location of the sendmail executable. Defaults to <tt>/usr/sbin/sendmail</tt>.
  * <tt>:arguments</tt> - The command line arguments. Defaults to <tt>-i -t</tt> with <tt>-f sender@address</tt>
    added automatically before the message is sent.

* <tt>file_settings</tt> - Allows you to override options for the <tt>:file</tt> delivery method.
  * <tt>:location</tt> - The directory into which emails will be written. Defaults to the application
    <tt>tmp/mails</tt>.

* <tt>raise_delivery_errors</tt> - Whether or not errors should be raised if the email fails to be delivered.

* <tt>delivery_method</tt> - Defines a delivery method. Possible values are <tt>:smtp</tt> (default),
  <tt>:sendmail</tt>, <tt>:test</tt>, and <tt>:file</tt>. Or you may provide a custom delivery method
  object eg. MyOwnDeliveryMethodClass.new. See the Mail gem documentation on the interface you need to
  implement for a custom delivery agent.

* <tt>perform_deliveries</tt> - Determines whether emails are actually sent from Action Mailer when you
  call <tt>.deliver</tt> on an mail message or on an Action Mailer method. This is on by default but can
  be turned off to aid in functional testing.

* <tt>deliveries</tt> - Keeps an array of all the emails sent out through the Action Mailer with
  <tt>delivery_method :test</tt>. Most useful for unit and functional testing.
