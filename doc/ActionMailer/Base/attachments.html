<h1>ActionMailer::Base#attachments</h1>

Allows you to add attachments to an email, like so:

 mail.attachments['filename.jpg'] = File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg')

If you do this, then Mail will take the file name and work out the mime type
set the Content-Type, Content-Disposition, Content-Transfer-Encoding and
base64 encode the contents of the attachment all for you.

You can also specify overrides if you want by passing a hash instead of a string:

 mail.attachments['filename.jpg'] = {:mime_type => 'application/x-gzip',
                                     :content => File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg')}

If you want to use a different encoding than Base64, you can pass an encoding in,
but then it is up to you to pass in the content pre-encoded, and don't expect
Mail to know how to decode this data:

 file_content = SpecialEncode(File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg'))
 mail.attachments['filename.jpg'] = {:mime_type => 'application/x-gzip',
                                     :encoding => 'SpecialEncoding',
                                     :content => file_content }

You can also search for specific attachments:

 # By Filename
 mail.attachments['filename.jpg']   # => Mail::Part object or nil

 # or by index
 mail.attachments[0]                # => Mail::Part (first attachment)
