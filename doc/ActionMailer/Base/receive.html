<h1>ActionMailer::Base.receive</h1>

Receives a raw email, parses it into an email object, decodes it,
instantiates a new mailer, and passes the email object to the mailer
object's +receive+ method. If you want your mailer to be able to
process incoming messages, you'll need to implement a +receive+
method that accepts the raw email string as a parameter:

  class MyMailer < ActionMailer::Base
    def receive(mail)
      ...
    end
  end
