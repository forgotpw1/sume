<h1>ActionMailer::Base#headers</h1>

Allows you to pass random and unusual headers to the new <tt>Mail::Message</tt> object
which will add them to itself.

  headers['X-Special-Domain-Specific-Header'] = "SecretValue"

You can also pass a hash into headers of header field names and values, which
will then be set on the Mail::Message object:

  headers 'X-Special-Domain-Specific-Header' => "SecretValue",
          'In-Reply-To' => incoming.message_id

The resulting Mail::Message will have the following in its header:

  X-Special-Domain-Specific-Header: SecretValue
