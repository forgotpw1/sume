<h1>ActionMailer::Base.deliver_mail</h1>

Wraps an email delivery inside of Active Support Notifications instrumentation. This
method is actually called by the <tt>Mail::Message</tt> object itself through a callback
when you call <tt>:deliver</tt> on the Mail::Message, calling +deliver_mail+ directly
and passing a Mail::Message will do nothing except tell the logger you sent the email.
