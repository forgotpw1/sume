<h1>HTML::Selector#next_selector</h1>

Called to create a dependent selector (sibling, descendant, etc).
Passes the remainder of the statement that will be reduced to zero
eventually, and array of substitution values.

This method is called from four places, so it helps to put it here
for reuse. The only logic deals with the need to detect comma
separators (alternate) and apply them to the selector group of the
top selector.
