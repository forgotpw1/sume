A simple HTML tokenizer. It simply breaks a stream of text into tokens, where each
token is a string. Each string represents either "text", or an HTML element.

This currently assumes valid XHTML, which means no free < or > characters.

Usage:

  tokenizer = HTML::Tokenizer.new(text)
  while token = tokenizer.next
    p token
  end
