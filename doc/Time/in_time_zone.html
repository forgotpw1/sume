<h1>Time#in_time_zone</h1>

Returns the simultaneous time in <tt>Time.zone</tt>.

  Time.zone = 'Hawaii'         # => 'Hawaii'
  Time.utc(2000).in_time_zone  # => Fri, 31 Dec 1999 14:00:00 HST -10:00

This method is similar to Time#localtime, except that it uses <tt>Time.zone</tt> as the local zone
instead of the operating system's time zone.

You can also pass in a TimeZone instance or string that identifies a TimeZone as an argument,
and the conversion will be based on that zone instead of <tt>Time.zone</tt>.

  Time.utc(2000).in_time_zone('Alaska')  # => Fri, 31 Dec 1999 15:00:00 AKST -09:00
