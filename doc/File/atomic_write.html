<h1>File.atomic_write</h1>


<p>Write to a file atomically.  Useful for situations where you don't want
other processes or threads to see half-written files.</p>

<pre>File.atomic_write(&quot;important.file&quot;) do |file|
  file.write(&quot;hello&quot;)
end</pre>

<p>If your temp directory is not on the same filesystem as the file you're
trying to write, you can provide a different temporary directory.</p>

<pre>File.atomic_write(&quot;/data/something.important&quot;, &quot;/data/tmp&quot;) do |file|
  file.write(&quot;hello&quot;)
end</pre>
