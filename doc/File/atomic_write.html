<h1>File.atomic_write</h1>

Write to a file atomically. Useful for situations where you don't
want other processes or threads to see half-written files.

  File.atomic_write('important.file') do |file|
    file.write('hello')
  end

If your temp directory is not on the same filesystem as the file you're
trying to write, you can provide a different temporary directory.

  File.atomic_write('/data/something.important', '/data/tmp') do |file|
    file.write('hello')
  end
