<h1>ActionDispatch::Request#remote_ip</h1>


<p>Determines originating IP address.  REMOTE_ADDR is the standard but will
fail if the user is behind a proxy.  HTTP_CLIENT_IP and/or
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR are set by proxies so check for these if REMOTE_ADDR
is a proxy.  HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR may be a comma- delimited list in the
case of multiple chained proxies; the last address which is not trusted is
the originating IP.</p>
