<h1>ActionDispatch::Request#request_method</h1>


<p>Returns the HTTP method that the application should see. In the case where
the method was overridden by a middleware (for instance, if a HEAD request
was converted to a GET, or if a _method parameter was used to determine the
method the application should use), this method returns the overridden
value, not the original.</p>
