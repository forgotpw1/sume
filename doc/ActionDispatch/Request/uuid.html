<h1>ActionDispatch::Request#uuid</h1>

Returns the unique request id, which is based off either the X-Request-Id header that can
be generated by a firewall, load balancer, or web server or by the RequestId middleware
(which sets the action_dispatch.request_id environment variable).

This unique ID is useful for tracing a request from end-to-end as part of logging or debugging.
This relies on the rack variable set by the ActionDispatch::RequestId middleware.
