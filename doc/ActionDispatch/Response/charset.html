<h1>ActionDispatch::Response#charset</h1>

Sets the HTTP response's content MIME type. For example, in the controller
you could write this:

 response.content_type = "text/plain"

If a character set has been defined for this response (see charset=) then
the character set information will also be included in the content type
information.
