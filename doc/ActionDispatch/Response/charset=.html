<h1>ActionDispatch::Response#charset=</h1>


<p>Sets the HTTP response's content MIME type. For example, in the controller
you could write this:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">response.content_type = &quot;text/plain&quot;</pre>

<p>If a character set has been defined for this response (see charset=) then
the character set information will also be included in the content type
information.</p>
