This middleware rescues any exception returned by the application
and calls an exceptions app that will wrap it in a format for the end user.

The exceptions app should be passed as parameter on initialization
of ShowExceptions. Everytime there is an exception, ShowExceptions will
store the exception in env["action_dispatch.exception"], rewrite the
PATH_INFO to the exception status code and call the rack app.

If the application returns a "X-Cascade" pass response, this middleware
will send an empty response as result with the correct status code.
If any exception happens inside the exceptions app, this middleware
catches the exceptions and returns a FAILSAFE_RESPONSE.
