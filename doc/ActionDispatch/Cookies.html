\Cookies are read and written through ActionController#cookies.

The cookies being read are the ones received along with the request, the cookies
being written will be sent out with the response. Reading a cookie does not get
the cookie object itself back, just the value it holds.

Examples for writing:

  # Sets a simple session cookie.
  # This cookie will be deleted when the user's browser is closed.
  cookies[:user_name] = "david"

  # Assign an array of values to a cookie.
  cookies[:lat_lon] = [47.68, -122.37]

  # Sets a cookie that expires in 1 hour.
  cookies[:login] = { :value => "XJ-122", :expires => 1.hour.from_now }

  # Sets a signed cookie, which prevents a user from tampering with its value.
  # The cookie is signed by your app's <tt>config.secret_token</tt> value.
  # Rails generates this value by default when you create a new Rails app.
  cookies.signed[:user_id] = current_user.id

  # Sets a "permanent" cookie (which expires in 20 years from now).
  cookies.permanent[:login] = "XJ-122"

  # You can also chain these methods:
  cookies.permanent.signed[:login] = "XJ-122"

Examples for reading:

  cookies[:user_name] # => "david"
  cookies.size        # => 2
  cookies[:lat_lon]   # => [47.68, -122.37]

Example for deleting:

  cookies.delete :user_name

Please note that if you specify a :domain when setting a cookie, you must also specify the domain when deleting the cookie:

 cookies[:key] = {
   :value => 'a yummy cookie',
   :expires => 1.year.from_now,
   :domain => 'domain.com'
 }

 cookies.delete(:key, :domain => 'domain.com')

The option symbols for setting cookies are:

* <tt>:value</tt> - The cookie's value or list of values (as an array).
* <tt>:path</tt> - The path for which this cookie applies.  Defaults to the root
  of the application.
* <tt>:domain</tt> - The domain for which this cookie applies so you can
  restrict to the domain level. If you use a schema like www.example.com
  and want to share session with user.example.com set <tt>:domain</tt>
  to <tt>:all</tt>. Make sure to specify the <tt>:domain</tt> option with
  <tt>:all</tt> again when deleting keys.

    :domain => nil  # Does not sets cookie domain. (default)
    :domain => :all # Allow the cookie for the top most level
                      domain and subdomains.

* <tt>:expires</tt> - The time at which this cookie expires, as a \Time object.
* <tt>:secure</tt> - Whether this cookie is a only transmitted to HTTPS servers.
  Default is +false+.
* <tt>:httponly</tt> - Whether this cookie is accessible via scripting or
  only HTTP. Defaults to +false+.
