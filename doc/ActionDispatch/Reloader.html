ActionDispatch::Reloader provides prepare and cleanup callbacks,
intended to assist with code reloading during development.

Prepare callbacks are run before each request, and cleanup callbacks
after each request. In this respect they are analogs of ActionDispatch::Callback's
before and after callbacks. However, cleanup callbacks are not called until the
request is fully complete -- that is, after #close has been called on
the response body. This is important for streaming responses such as the
following:

    self.response_body = lambda { |response, output|
      # code here which refers to application models
    }

Cleanup callbacks will not be called until after the response_body lambda
is evaluated, ensuring that it can refer to application models and other
classes before they are unloaded.

By default, ActionDispatch::Reloader is included in the middleware stack
only in the development environment; specifically, when +config.cache_classes+
is false. Callbacks may be registered even when it is not included in the
middleware stack, but are executed only when <tt>ActionDispatch::Reloader.prepare!</tt>
or <tt>ActionDispatch::Reloader.cleanup!</tt> are called manually.
