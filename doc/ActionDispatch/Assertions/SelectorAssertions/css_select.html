<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::SelectorAssertions#css_select</h1>


<p>Select and return all matching elements.</p>

<p>If called with a single argument, uses that argument as a selector to match
all elements of the current page. Returns an empty array if no match is
found.</p>

<p>If called with two arguments, uses the first argument as the base element
and the second argument as the selector. Attempts to match the base element
and any of its children. Returns an empty array if no match is found.</p>

<p>The selector may be a CSS selector expression (String), an expression with
substitution values (Array) or an HTML::Selector object.</p>
