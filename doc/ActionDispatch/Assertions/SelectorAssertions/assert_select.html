<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::SelectorAssertions#assert_select</h1>


<p>An assertion that selects elements and makes one or more equality tests.</p>

<p>If the first argument is an element, selects all matching elements starting
from (and including) that element and all its children in depth-first
order.</p>

<p>If no element if specified, calling <tt>assert_select</tt> selects from the
response HTML unless <tt>assert_select</tt> is called from within an
<tt>assert_select</tt> block.</p>

<p>When called with a block <tt>assert_select</tt> passes an array of selected
elements to the block. Calling <tt>assert_select</tt> from the block, with
no element specified, runs the assertion on the complete set of elements
selected by the enclosing assertion. Alternatively the array may be
iterated through so that <tt>assert_select</tt> can be called separately
for each element.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If the response contains two ordered lists, each with four list elements
then:</p>

<pre>assert_select &quot;ol&quot; do |elements|
  elements.each do |element|
    assert_select element, &quot;li&quot;, 4
  end
end</pre>

<p>will pass, as will:</p>

<pre>assert_select &quot;ol&quot; do
  assert_select &quot;li&quot;, 8
end</pre>

<p>The selector may be a CSS selector expression (String), an expression with
substitution values, or an HTML::Selector object.</p>

<h3>Equality Tests</h3>

<p>The equality test may be one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>true</tt> - Assertion is true if at least one element selected.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>false</tt> - Assertion is true if no element selected.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>String/Regexp</tt> - Assertion is true if the text value of at least
one element matches the string or regular expression.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Integer</tt> - Assertion is true if exactly that number of elements are
selected.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>Range</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements fit
the range.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If no equality test specified, the assertion is true if at least one
element selected.</p>

<p>To perform more than one equality tests, use a hash with the following
keys:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:text</tt> - Narrow the selection to elements that have this text value
(string or regexp).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:html</tt> - Narrow the selection to elements that have this HTML
content (string or regexp).</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:count</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is
equal to this value.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:minimum</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is
at least this value.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:maximum</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is
at most this value.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If the method is called with a block, once all equality tests are evaluated
the block is called with an array of all matched elements.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre># At least one form element
assert_select &quot;form&quot;

# Form element includes four input fields
assert_select &quot;form input&quot;, 4

# Page title is &quot;Welcome&quot;
assert_select &quot;title&quot;, &quot;Welcome&quot;

# Page title is &quot;Welcome&quot; and there is only one title element
assert_select &quot;title&quot;, {:count =&gt; 1, :text =&gt; &quot;Welcome&quot;},
    &quot;Wrong title or more than one title element&quot;

# Page contains no forms
assert_select &quot;form&quot;, false, &quot;This page must contain no forms&quot;

# Test the content and style
assert_select &quot;body div.header ul.menu&quot;

# Use substitution values
assert_select &quot;ol&gt;li#?&quot;, /item-\d+/

# All input fields in the form have a name
assert_select &quot;form input&quot; do
  assert_select &quot;[name=?]&quot;, /.+/  # Not empty
end</pre>
