<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::RoutingAssertions#with_routing</h1>

A helper to make it easier to test different route configurations.
This method temporarily replaces @routes
with a new RouteSet instance.

The new instance is yielded to the passed block. Typically the block
will create some routes using <tt>map.draw { map.connect ... }</tt>:

  with_routing do |set|
    set.draw do |map|
      map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
        assert_equal(
          ['/content/10/show', {}],
          map.generate(:controller => 'content', :id => 10, :action => 'show')
      end
    end
  end
