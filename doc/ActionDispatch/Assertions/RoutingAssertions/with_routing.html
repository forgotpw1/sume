<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::RoutingAssertions#with_routing</h1>


<p>A helper to make it easier to test different route configurations. This
method temporarily replaces @routes with a new RouteSet instance.</p>

<p>The new instance is yielded to the passed block. Typically the block will
create some routes using <tt>map.draw { map.connect ... }</tt>:</p>

<pre>with_routing do |set|
  set.draw do |map|
    map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
      assert_equal(
        ['/content/10/show', {}],
        map.generate(:controller =&gt; 'content', :id =&gt; 10, :action =&gt; 'show')
    end
  end
end</pre>
