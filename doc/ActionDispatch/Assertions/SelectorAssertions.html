Adds the +assert_select+ method for use in Rails functional
test cases, which can be used to make assertions on the response HTML of a controller
action. You can also call +assert_select+ within another +assert_select+ to
make assertions on elements selected by the enclosing assertion.

Use +css_select+ to select elements without making an assertions, either
from the response HTML or elements selected by the enclosing assertion.

In addition to HTML responses, you can make the following assertions:

* +assert_select_encoded+ - Assertions on HTML encoded inside XML, for example for dealing with feed item descriptions.
* +assert_select_email+ - Assertions on the HTML body of an e-mail.

Also see HTML::Selector to learn how to use selectors.
