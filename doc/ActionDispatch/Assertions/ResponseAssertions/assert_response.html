<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::ResponseAssertions#assert_response</h1>

Asserts that the response is one of the following types:

* <tt>:success</tt>   - Status code was in the 200-299 range
* <tt>:redirect</tt>  - Status code was in the 300-399 range
* <tt>:missing</tt>   - Status code was 404
* <tt>:error</tt>     - Status code was in the 500-599 range

You can also pass an explicit status number like <tt>assert_response(501)</tt>
or its symbolic equivalent <tt>assert_response(:not_implemented)</tt>.
See Rack::Utils::SYMBOL_TO_STATUS_CODE for a full list.
