<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::ResponseAssertions#assert_redirected_to</h1>

Assert that the redirection options passed in match those of the redirect called in the latest action.
This match can be partial, such that <tt>assert_redirected_to(:controller => "weblog")</tt> will also
match the redirection of <tt>redirect_to(:controller => "weblog", :action => "show")</tt> and so on.

  # assert that the redirection was to the "index" action on the WeblogController
  assert_redirected_to :controller => "weblog", :action => "index"

  # assert that the redirection was to the named route login_url
  assert_redirected_to login_url

  # assert that the redirection was to the url for @customer
  assert_redirected_to @customer

  # asserts that the redirection matches the regular expression
  assert_redirected_to %r(\Ahttp://example.org)
