<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::ResponseAssertions#assert_redirected_to</h1>


<p>Assert that the redirection options passed in match those of the redirect
called in the latest action. This match can be partial, such that
<tt>assert_redirected_to(:controller =&gt; &quot;weblog&quot;)</tt> will
also match the redirection of <tt>redirect_to(:controller =&gt;
&quot;weblog&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;)</tt> and so on.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre># assert that the redirection was to the &quot;index&quot; action on the WeblogController
assert_redirected_to :controller =&gt; &quot;weblog&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot;

# assert that the redirection was to the named route login_url
assert_redirected_to login_url

# assert that the redirection was to the url for @customer
assert_redirected_to @customer</pre>
