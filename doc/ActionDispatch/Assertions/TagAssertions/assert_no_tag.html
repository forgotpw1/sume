<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::TagAssertions#assert_no_tag</h1>

Identical to +assert_tag+, but asserts that a matching tag does _not_
exist. (See +assert_tag+ for a full discussion of the syntax.)

  # Assert that there is not a "div" containing a "p"
  assert_no_tag :tag => "div", :descendant => { :tag => "p" }

  # Assert that an unordered list is empty
  assert_no_tag :tag => "ul", :descendant => { :tag => "li" }

  # Assert that there is not a "p" tag with between 1 to 3 "img" tags
  # as immediate children
  assert_no_tag :tag => "p",
             :children => { :count => 1..3, :only => { :tag => "img" } }
