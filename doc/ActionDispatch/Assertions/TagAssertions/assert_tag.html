<h1>ActionDispatch::Assertions::TagAssertions#assert_tag</h1>


<p>Asserts that there is a tag/node/element in the body of the response that
meets all of the given conditions. The <tt>conditions</tt> parameter must
be a hash of any of the following keys (all are optional):</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:tag</tt>: the node type must match the corresponding value</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:attributes</tt>: a hash. The node's attributes must match the
corresponding values in the hash.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:parent</tt>: a hash. The node's parent must match the corresponding
hash.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:child</tt>: a hash. At least one of the node's immediate children must
meet the criteria described by the hash.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:ancestor</tt>: a hash. At least one of the node's ancestors must meet
the criteria described by the hash.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:descendant</tt>: a hash. At least one of the node's descendants must
meet the criteria described by the hash.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:sibling</tt>: a hash. At least one of the node's siblings must meet
the criteria described by the hash.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:after</tt>: a hash. The node must be after any sibling meeting the
criteria described by the hash, and at least one sibling must match.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:before</tt>: a hash. The node must be before any sibling meeting the
criteria described by the hash, and at least one sibling must match.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:children</tt>: a hash, for counting children of a node. Accepts the
keys:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>:count</tt>: either a number or a range which must equal (or include)
the number of children that match.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:less_than</tt>: the number of matching children must be less than this
number.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:greater_than</tt>: the number of matching children must be greater
than this number.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:only</tt>: another hash consisting of the keys to use to match on the
children, and only matching children will be counted.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p><tt>:content</tt>: the textual content of the node must match the given
value. This will not match HTML tags in the body of a tag--only text.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Conditions are matched using the following algorithm:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>if the condition is a string, it must be a substring of the value.</p>
</li><li>
<p>if the condition is a regexp, it must match the value.</p>
</li><li>
<p>if the condition is a number, the value must match number.to_s.</p>
</li><li>
<p>if the condition is <tt>true</tt>, the value must not be <tt>nil</tt>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>if the condition is <tt>false</tt> or <tt>nil</tt>, the value must be
<tt>nil</tt>.</p>
</li></ul>

<pre># Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; tag
assert_tag :tag =&gt; &quot;span&quot;

# Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; tag with id=&quot;x&quot;
assert_tag :tag =&gt; &quot;span&quot;, :attributes =&gt; { :id =&gt; &quot;x&quot; }

# Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; tag using the short-hand
assert_tag :span

# Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; tag with id=&quot;x&quot; using the short-hand
assert_tag :span, :attributes =&gt; { :id =&gt; &quot;x&quot; }

# Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; inside of a &quot;div&quot;
assert_tag :tag =&gt; &quot;span&quot;, :parent =&gt; { :tag =&gt; &quot;div&quot; }

# Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; somewhere inside a table

# Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; containing a (possibly nested)
# &quot;strong&quot; tag.
assert_tag :tag =&gt; &quot;span&quot;, :descendant =&gt; { :tag =&gt; &quot;strong&quot; }

# Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; containing between 2 and 4 &quot;em&quot; tags

assert_tag :tag =&gt; &quot;span&quot;,
           :children =&gt; { :count =&gt; 2..4, :only =&gt; { :tag =&gt; &quot;em&quot; } }

# Get funky: assert that there is a &quot;div&quot;, with an &quot;ul&quot; ancestor
# and an &quot;li&quot; parent (with &quot;class&quot; = &quot;enum&quot;), and containing a
# &quot;span&quot; descendant that contains text matching /hello world/
assert_tag :tag =&gt; &quot;div&quot;,
           :ancestor =&gt; { :tag =&gt; &quot;ul&quot; },
           :parent =&gt; { :tag =&gt; &quot;li&quot;,
                        :attributes =&gt; { :class =&gt; &quot;enum&quot; } },
           :descendant =&gt; { :tag =&gt; &quot;span&quot;,
                            :child =&gt; /hello world/ }</pre>

<p><b>Please note</b>: <tt>assert_tag</tt> and <tt>assert_no_tag</tt> only
work with well-formed XHTML. They recognize a few tags as implicitly
self-closing (like br and hr and such) but will not work correctly with
tags that allow optional closing tags (p, li, td). <em>You must explicitly
close all of your tags to use these assertions.</em></p>
