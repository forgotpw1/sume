<h1>ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar#signed</h1>


<p>Returns a jar that'll automatically generate a signed representation of
cookie value and verify it when reading from the cookie again. This is
useful for creating cookies with values that the user is not supposed to
change. If a signed cookie was tampered with by the user (or a 3rd party),
an ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier::InvalidSignature exception will be
raised.</p>

<p>This jar requires that you set a suitable secret for the verification on
your app's config.secret_token.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>cookies.signed[:discount] = 45
# =&gt; Set-Cookie: discount=BAhpMg==--2c1c6906c90a3bc4fd54a51ffb41dffa4bf6b5f7; path=/

cookies.signed[:discount] # =&gt; 45</pre>
