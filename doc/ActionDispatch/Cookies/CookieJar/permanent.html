<h1>ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar#permanent</h1>


<p>Returns a jar that'll automatically set the assigned cookies to have an
expiration date 20 years from now. Example:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">cookies.permanent[:prefers_open_id] = true
# =&gt; Set-Cookie: prefers_open_id=true; path=/; expires=Sun, 16-Dec-2029 03:24:16 GMT</pre>

<p>This jar is only meant for writing. You'll read permanent cookies through
the regular accessor.</p>

<p>This jar allows chaining with the signed jar as well, so you can set
permanent, signed cookies. Examples:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">cookies.permanent.signed[:remember_me] = current_user.id
# =&gt; Set-Cookie: remember_me=BAhU--848956038e692d7046deab32b7131856ab20e14e; path=/; expires=Sun, 16-Dec-2029 03:24:16 GMT</pre>
