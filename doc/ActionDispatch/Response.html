Represents an HTTP response generated by a controller action. Use it to
retrieve the current state of the response, or customize the response. It can
either represent a real HTTP response (i.e. one that is meant to be sent
back to the web browser) or a TestResponse (i.e. one that is generated
from integration tests).

\Response is mostly a Ruby on \Rails framework implementation detail, and
should never be used directly in controllers. Controllers should use the
methods defined in ActionController::Base instead. For example, if you want
to set the HTTP response's content MIME type, then use
ActionControllerBase#headers instead of Response#headers.

Nevertheless, integration tests may want to inspect controller responses in
more detail, and that's when \Response can be useful for application
developers. Integration test methods such as
ActionDispatch::Integration::Session#get and
ActionDispatch::Integration::Session#post return objects of type
TestResponse (which are of course also of type \Response).

For example, the following demo integration test prints the body of the
controller response to the console:

 class DemoControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
   def test_print_root_path_to_console
     get('/')
     puts @response.body
   end
 end
