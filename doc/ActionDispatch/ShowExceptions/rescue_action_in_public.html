<h1>ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions#rescue_action_in_public</h1>


<p>Attempts to render a static error page based on the <tt>status_code</tt>
thrown, or just return headers if no such file exists. At first, it will
try to render a localized static page. For example, if a 500 error is being
handled Rails and locale is :da, it will first attempt to render the file
at <tt>public/500.da.html</tt> then attempt to render
<tt>public/500.html</tt>. If none of them exist, the body of the response
will be left empty.</p>
