<h1>ActionDispatch::Flash::FlashHash#now</h1>


<p>Sets a flash that will not be available to the next action, only to the
current.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">flash.now[:message] = &quot;Hello current action&quot;</pre>

<p>This method enables you to use the flash as a central messaging system in
your app. When you need to pass an object to the next action, you use the
standard flash assign (<tt>[]=</tt>). When you need to pass an object to
the current action, you use <tt>now</tt>, and your object will vanish when
the current action is done.</p>

<p>Entries set via <tt>now</tt> are accessed the same way as standard entries:
<tt>flash['my-key']</tt>.</p>
