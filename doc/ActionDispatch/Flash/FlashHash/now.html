<h1>ActionDispatch::Flash::FlashHash#now</h1>

Sets a flash that will not be available to the next action, only to the current.

    flash.now[:message] = "Hello current action"

This method enables you to use the flash as a central messaging system in your app.
When you need to pass an object to the next action, you use the standard flash assign (<tt>[]=</tt>).
When you need to pass an object to the current action, you use <tt>now</tt>, and your object will
vanish when the current action is done.

Entries set via <tt>now</tt> are accessed the same way as standard entries: <tt>flash['my-key']</tt>.
