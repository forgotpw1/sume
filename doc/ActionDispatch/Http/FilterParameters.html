Allows you to specify sensitive parameters which will be replaced from
the request log by looking in the query string of the request and all
subhashes of the params hash to filter. If a block is given, each key and
value of the params hash and all subhashes is passed to it, the value
or key can be replaced using String#replace or similar method.

  env["action_dispatch.parameter_filter"] = [:password]
  => replaces the value to all keys matching /password/i with "[FILTERED]"

  env["action_dispatch.parameter_filter"] = [:foo, "bar"]
  => replaces the value to all keys matching /foo|bar/i with "[FILTERED]"

  env["action_dispatch.parameter_filter"] = lambda do |k,v|
    v.reverse! if k =~ /secret/i
  end
  => reverses the value to all keys matching /secret/i
