<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Redirection#redirect</h1>

Redirect any path to another path:

  match "/stories" => redirect("/posts")

You can also use interpolation in the supplied redirect argument:

  match 'docs/:article', :to => redirect('/wiki/%{article}')

Alternatively you can use one of the other syntaxes:

The block version of redirect allows for the easy encapsulation of any logic associated with
the redirect in question. Either the params and request are supplied as arguments, or just
params, depending of how many arguments your block accepts. A string is required as a
return value.

  match 'jokes/:number', :to => redirect { |params, request|
    path = (params[:number].to_i.even? ? "wheres-the-beef" : "i-love-lamp")
    "http://#{request.host_with_port}/#{path}"
  }

Note that the +do end+ syntax for the redirect block wouldn't work, as Ruby would pass
the block to +match+ instead of +redirect+. Use <tt>{ ... }</tt> instead.

The options version of redirect allows you to supply only the parts of the url which need
to change, it also supports interpolation of the path similar to the first example.

  match 'stores/:name',       :to => redirect(:subdomain => 'stores', :path => '/%{name}')
  match 'stores/:name(*all)', :to => redirect(:subdomain => 'stores', :path => '/%{name}%{all}')

Finally, an object which responds to call can be supplied to redirect, allowing you to reuse
common redirect routes. The call method must accept two arguments, params and request, and return
a string.

  match 'accounts/:name' => redirect(SubdomainRedirector.new('api'))
