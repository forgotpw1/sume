<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet::Dispatcher#controller</h1>

If this is a default_controller (i.e. a controller specified by the user)
we should raise an error in case it's not found, because it usually means
a user error. However, if the controller was retrieved through a dynamic
segment, as in :controller(/:action), we should simply return nil and
delegate the control back to Rack cascade. Besides, if this is not a default
controller, it means we should respect the @scope[:module] parameter.
