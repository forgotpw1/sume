<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet::Generator#normalize_controller_action_id!</h1>

This pulls :controller, :action, and :id out of the recall.
The recall key is only used if there is no key in the options
or if the key in the options is identical. If any of
:controller, :action or :id is not found, don't pull any
more keys from the recall.
