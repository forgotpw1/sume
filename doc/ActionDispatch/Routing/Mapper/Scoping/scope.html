<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Scoping#scope</h1>

Scopes a set of routes to the given default options.

Take the following route definition as an example:

  scope :path => ":account_id", :as => "account" do
    resources :projects
  end

This generates helpers such as +account_projects_path+, just like +resources+ does.
The difference here being that the routes generated are like /:account_id/projects,
rather than /accounts/:account_id/projects.

=== Options

Takes same options as <tt>Base#match</tt> and <tt>Resources#resources</tt>.

=== Examples

  # route /posts (without the prefix /admin) to <tt>Admin::PostsController</tt>
  scope :module => "admin" do
    resources :posts
  end

  # prefix the posts resource's requests with '/admin'
  scope :path => "/admin" do
    resources :posts
  end

  # prefix the routing helper name: +sekret_posts_path+ instead of +posts_path+
  scope :as => "sekret" do
    resources :posts
  end
