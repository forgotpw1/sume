<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Scoping#constraints</h1>

=== Parameter Restriction
Allows you to constrain the nested routes based on a set of rules.
For instance, in order to change the routes to allow for a dot character in the +id+ parameter:

  constraints(:id => /\d+\.\d+/) do
    resources :posts
  end

Now routes such as +/posts/1+ will no longer be valid, but +/posts/1.1+ will be.
The +id+ parameter must match the constraint passed in for this example.

You may use this to also restrict other parameters:

  resources :posts do
    constraints(:post_id => /\d+\.\d+/) do
      resources :comments
    end
  end

=== Restricting based on IP

Routes can also be constrained to an IP or a certain range of IP addresses:

  constraints(:ip => /192.168.\d+.\d+/) do
    resources :posts
  end

Any user connecting from the 192.168.* range will be able to see this resource,
where as any user connecting outside of this range will be told there is no such route.

=== Dynamic request matching

Requests to routes can be constrained based on specific criteria:

   constraints(lambda { |req| req.env["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] =~ /iPhone/ }) do
     resources :iphones
   end

You are able to move this logic out into a class if it is too complex for routes.
This class must have a +matches?+ method defined on it which either returns +true+
if the user should be given access to that route, or +false+ if the user should not.

   class Iphone
     def self.matches?(request)
       request.env["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] =~ /iPhone/
     end
   end

An expected place for this code would be +lib/constraints+.

This class is then used like this:

   constraints(Iphone) do
     resources :iphones
   end
