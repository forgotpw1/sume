<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Base#root</h1>

You can specify what Rails should route "/" to with the root method:

  root :to => 'pages#main'

For options, see +match+, as +root+ uses it internally.

You can also pass a string which will expand

  root 'pages#main'

You should put the root route at the top of <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>,
because this means it will be matched first. As this is the most popular route
of most Rails applications, this is beneficial.
