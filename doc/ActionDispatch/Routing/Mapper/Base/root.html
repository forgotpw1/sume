<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Base#root</h1>


<p>You can specify what Rails should route "/" to with the root method:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">root :to =&gt; 'pages#main'</pre>

<p>For options, see <tt>match</tt>, as <tt>root</tt> uses it internally.</p>

<p>You should put the root route at the top of <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>,
because this means it will be matched first. As this is the most popular
route of most Rails applications, this is beneficial.</p>
