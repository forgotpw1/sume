<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Base#mount</h1>


<p>Mount a Rack-based application to be used within the application.</p>

<pre>mount SomeRackApp, :at =&gt; &quot;some_route&quot;</pre>

<p>Alternatively:</p>

<pre>mount(SomeRackApp =&gt; &quot;some_route&quot;)</pre>

<p>For options, see <tt>match</tt>, as <tt>mount</tt> uses it internally.</p>

<p>All mounted applications come with routing helpers to access them. These
are named after the class specified, so for the above example the helper is
either <tt>some_rack_app_path</tt> or <tt>some_rack_app_url</tt>. To
customize this helper's name, use the <tt>:as</tt> option:</p>

<pre>mount(SomeRackApp =&gt; &quot;some_route&quot;, :as =&gt; &quot;exciting&quot;)</pre>

<p>This will generate the <tt>exciting_path</tt> and <tt>exciting_url</tt>
helpers which can be used to navigate to this mounted app.</p>
