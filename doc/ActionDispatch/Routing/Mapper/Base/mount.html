<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Base#mount</h1>

Mount a Rack-based application to be used within the application.

  mount SomeRackApp, :at => "some_route"

Alternatively:

  mount(SomeRackApp => "some_route")

For options, see +match+, as +mount+ uses it internally.

All mounted applications come with routing helpers to access them.
These are named after the class specified, so for the above example
the helper is either +some_rack_app_path+ or +some_rack_app_url+.
To customize this helper's name, use the +:as+ option:

  mount(SomeRackApp => "some_route", :as => "exciting")

This will generate the +exciting_path+ and +exciting_url+ helpers
which can be used to navigate to this mounted app.
