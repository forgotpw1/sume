Resource routing allows you to quickly declare all of the common routes
for a given resourceful controller. Instead of declaring separate routes
for your +index+, +show+, +new+, +edit+, +create+, +update+ and +destroy+
actions, a resourceful route declares them in a single line of code:

 resources :photos

Sometimes, you have a resource that clients always look up without
referencing an ID. A common example, /profile always shows the profile of
the currently logged in user. In this case, you can use a singular resource
to map /profile (rather than /profile/:id) to the show action.

 resource :profile

It's common to have resources that are logically children of other
resources:

  resources :magazines do
    resources :ads
  end

You may wish to organize groups of controllers under a namespace. Most
commonly, you might group a number of administrative controllers under
an +admin+ namespace. You would place these controllers under the
<tt>app/controllers/admin</tt> directory, and you can group them together
in your router:

  namespace "admin" do
    resources :posts, :comments
  end

By default the +:id+ parameter doesn't accept dots. If you need to
use dots as part of the +:id+ parameter add a constraint which
overrides this restriction, e.g:

  resources :articles, :id => /[^\/]+/

This allows any character other than a slash as part of your +:id+.
