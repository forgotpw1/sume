You may wish to organize groups of controllers under a namespace.
Most commonly, you might group a number of administrative controllers
under an +admin+ namespace. You would place these controllers under
the <tt>app/controllers/admin</tt> directory, and you can group them
together in your router:

  namespace "admin" do
    resources :posts, :comments
  end

This will create a number of routes for each of the posts and comments
controller. For <tt>Admin::PostsController</tt>, Rails will create:

  GET	    /admin/posts
  GET	    /admin/posts/new
  POST	  /admin/posts
  GET	    /admin/posts/1
  GET	    /admin/posts/1/edit
  PUT	    /admin/posts/1
  DELETE  /admin/posts/1

If you want to route /posts (without the prefix /admin) to
<tt>Admin::PostsController</tt>, you could use

  scope :module => "admin" do
    resources :posts
  end

or, for a single case

  resources :posts, :module => "admin"

If you want to route /admin/posts to +PostsController+
(without the Admin:: module prefix), you could use

  scope "/admin" do
    resources :posts
  end

or, for a single case

  resources :posts, :path => "/admin/posts"

In each of these cases, the named routes remain the same as if you did
not use scope. In the last case, the following paths map to
+PostsController+:

  GET	    /admin/posts
  GET	    /admin/posts/new
  POST	  /admin/posts
  GET	    /admin/posts/1
  GET	    /admin/posts/1/edit
  PUT	    /admin/posts/1
  DELETE  /admin/posts/1
