<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#resource</h1>


<p>Sometimes, you have a resource that clients always look up without
referencing an ID. A common example, /profile always shows the profile of
the currently logged in user. In this case, you can use a singular resource
to map /profile (rather than /profile/:id) to the show action:</p>

<pre>resource :geocoder</pre>

<p>creates six different routes in your application, all mapping to the
<tt>GeoCoders</tt> controller (note that the controller is named after the
plural):</p>

<pre>GET     /geocoder/new
POST    /geocoder
GET     /geocoder
GET     /geocoder/edit
PUT     /geocoder
DELETE  /geocoder</pre>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>Takes same options as <tt>resources</tt>.</p>
