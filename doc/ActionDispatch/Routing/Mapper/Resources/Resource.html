<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#resource</h1>

Sometimes, you have a resource that clients always look up without
referencing an ID. A common example, /profile always shows the
profile of the currently logged in user. In this case, you can use
a singular resource to map /profile (rather than /profile/:id) to
the show action:

  resource :geocoder

creates six different routes in your application, all mapping to
the +GeoCoders+ controller (note that the controller is named after
the plural):

  GET       /geocoder/new
  POST      /geocoder
  GET       /geocoder
  GET       /geocoder/edit
  PATCH/PUT /geocoder
  DELETE    /geocoder

=== Options
Takes same options as +resources+.
