<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#resources</h1>


<p>In Rails, a resourceful route provides a mapping between HTTP verbs and
URLs and controller actions. By convention, each action also maps to
particular CRUD operations in a database. A single entry in the routing
file, such as</p>

<pre>resources :photos</pre>

<p>creates seven different routes in your application, all mapping to the
<tt>Photos</tt> controller:</p>

<pre>GET     /photos/new
POST    /photos
GET     /photos/:id
GET     /photos/:id/edit
PUT     /photos/:id
DELETE  /photos/:id</pre>

<p>Resources can also be nested infinitely by using this block syntax:</p>

<pre>resources :photos do
  resources :comments
end</pre>

<p>This generates the following comments routes:</p>

<pre>GET     /photos/:id/comments/new
POST    /photos/:id/comments
GET     /photos/:id/comments/:id
GET     /photos/:id/comments/:id/edit
PUT     /photos/:id/comments/:id
DELETE  /photos/:id/comments/:id</pre>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>Takes same options as <tt>Base#match</tt> as well as:</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>:path_names</dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows you to change the paths of the seven default actions. Paths not
specified are not changed.</p>

<pre>resources :posts, :path_names =&gt; { :new =&gt; &quot;brand_new&quot; }</pre>

<p>The above example will now change /posts/new to /posts/brand_new</p>
</dd><dt>:only</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only generate routes for the given actions.</p>

<pre>resources :cows, :only =&gt; :show
resources :cows, :only =&gt; [:show, :index]</pre>
</dd><dt>:except</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate all routes except for the given actions.</p>

<pre>resources :cows, :except =&gt; :show
resources :cows, :except =&gt; [:show, :index]</pre>
</dd><dt>:shallow</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generates shallow routes for nested resource(s). When placed on a parent
resource, generates shallow routes for all nested resources.</p>

<pre>resources :posts, :shallow =&gt; true do
  resources :comments
end</pre>

<p>Is the same as:</p>

<pre>resources :posts do
  resources :comments, :except =&gt; [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
end
resources :comments, :only =&gt; [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]</pre>

<p>This allows URLs for resources that otherwise would be deeply nested such
as a comment on a blog post like
<tt>/posts/a-long-permalink/comments/1234</tt> to be shortened to just
<tt>/comments/1234</tt>.</p>
</dd><dt>:shallow_path</dt>
<dd>
<p>Prefixes nested shallow routes with the specified path.</p>

<p>scope :shallow_path =&gt; "sekret" do</p>

<pre>resources :posts do
  resources :comments, :shallow =&gt; true
end</pre>

<p>end</p>

<p>The <tt>comments</tt> resource here will have the following routes
generated for it:</p>

<pre>post_comments    GET    /posts/:post_id/comments(.:format)
post_comments    POST   /posts/:post_id/comments(.:format)
new_post_comment GET    /posts/:post_id/comments/new(.:format)
edit_comment     GET    /sekret/comments/:id/edit(.:format)
comment          GET    /sekret/comments/:id(.:format)
comment          PUT    /sekret/comments/:id(.:format)
comment          DELETE /sekret/comments/:id(.:format)</pre>
</dd></dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre># routes call &lt;tt&gt;Admin::PostsController&lt;/tt&gt;
resources :posts, :module =&gt; &quot;admin&quot;

# resource actions are at /admin/posts.
resources :posts, :path =&gt; &quot;admin/posts&quot;</pre>
