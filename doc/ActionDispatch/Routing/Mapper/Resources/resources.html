<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#resources</h1>

In Rails, a resourceful route provides a mapping between HTTP verbs
and URLs and controller actions. By convention, each action also maps
to particular CRUD operations in a database. A single entry in the
routing file, such as

  resources :photos

creates seven different routes in your application, all mapping to
the +Photos+ controller:

  GET       /photos
  GET       /photos/new
  POST      /photos
  GET       /photos/:id
  GET       /photos/:id/edit
  PATCH/PUT /photos/:id
  DELETE    /photos/:id

Resources can also be nested infinitely by using this block syntax:

  resources :photos do
    resources :comments
  end

This generates the following comments routes:

  GET       /photos/:photo_id/comments
  GET       /photos/:photo_id/comments/new
  POST      /photos/:photo_id/comments
  GET       /photos/:photo_id/comments/:id
  GET       /photos/:photo_id/comments/:id/edit
  PATCH/PUT /photos/:photo_id/comments/:id
  DELETE    /photos/:photo_id/comments/:id

=== Options
Takes same options as <tt>Base#match</tt> as well as:

[:path_names]
  Allows you to change the segment component of the +edit+ and +new+ actions.
  Actions not specified are not changed.

    resources :posts, :path_names => { :new => "brand_new" }

  The above example will now change /posts/new to /posts/brand_new

[:path]
  Allows you to change the path prefix for the resource.

    resources :posts, :path => 'postings'

  The resource and all segments will now route to /postings instead of /posts

[:only]
  Only generate routes for the given actions.

    resources :cows, :only => :show
    resources :cows, :only => [:show, :index]

[:except]
  Generate all routes except for the given actions.

    resources :cows, :except => :show
    resources :cows, :except => [:show, :index]

[:shallow]
  Generates shallow routes for nested resource(s). When placed on a parent resource,
  generates shallow routes for all nested resources.

    resources :posts, :shallow => true do
      resources :comments
    end

  Is the same as:

    resources :posts do
      resources :comments, :except => [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
    end
    resources :comments, :only => [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

  This allows URLs for resources that otherwise would be deeply nested such
  as a comment on a blog post like <tt>/posts/a-long-permalink/comments/1234</tt>
  to be shortened to just <tt>/comments/1234</tt>.

[:shallow_path]
  Prefixes nested shallow routes with the specified path.

    scope :shallow_path => "sekret" do
      resources :posts do
        resources :comments, :shallow => true
      end
    end

  The +comments+ resource here will have the following routes generated for it:

    post_comments    GET       /posts/:post_id/comments(.:format)
    post_comments    POST      /posts/:post_id/comments(.:format)
    new_post_comment GET       /posts/:post_id/comments/new(.:format)
    edit_comment     GET       /sekret/comments/:id/edit(.:format)
    comment          GET       /sekret/comments/:id(.:format)
    comment          PATCH/PUT /sekret/comments/:id(.:format)
    comment          DELETE    /sekret/comments/:id(.:format)

[:shallow_prefix]
  Prefixes nested shallow route names with specified prefix.

    scope :shallow_prefix => "sekret" do
      resources :posts do
        resources :comments, :shallow => true
      end
    end

  The +comments+ resource here will have the following routes generated for it:

    post_comments           GET       /posts/:post_id/comments(.:format)
    post_comments           POST      /posts/:post_id/comments(.:format)
    new_post_comment        GET       /posts/:post_id/comments/new(.:format)
    edit_sekret_comment     GET       /comments/:id/edit(.:format)
    sekret_comment          GET       /comments/:id(.:format)
    sekret_comment          PATCH/PUT /comments/:id(.:format)
    sekret_comment          DELETE    /comments/:id(.:format)

=== Examples

  # routes call <tt>Admin::PostsController</tt>
  resources :posts, :module => "admin"

  # resource actions are at /admin/posts.
  resources :posts, :path => "admin/posts"
