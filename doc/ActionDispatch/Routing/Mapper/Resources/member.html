<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#member</h1>

To add a member route, add a member block into the resource block:

  resources :photos do
    member do
      get 'preview'
    end
  end

This will recognize <tt>/photos/1/preview</tt> with GET, and route to the
preview action of +PhotosController+. It will also create the
<tt>preview_photo_url</tt> and <tt>preview_photo_path</tt> helpers.
