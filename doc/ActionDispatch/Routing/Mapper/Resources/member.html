<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#member</h1>


<p>To add a member route, add a member block into the resource block:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">resources :photos do
  member do
    get 'preview'
  end
end</pre>

<p>This will recognize <tt>/photos/1/preview</tt> with GET, and route to the
preview action of <tt>PhotosController</tt>. It will also create the
<tt>preview_photo_url</tt> and <tt>preview_photo_path</tt> helpers.</p>
