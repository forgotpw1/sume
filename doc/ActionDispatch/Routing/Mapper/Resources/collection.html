<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#collection</h1>

To add a route to the collection:

  resources :photos do
    collection do
      get 'search'
    end
  end

This will enable Rails to recognize paths such as <tt>/photos/search</tt>
with GET, and route to the search action of +PhotosController+. It will also
create the <tt>search_photos_url</tt> and <tt>search_photos_path</tt>
route helpers.
