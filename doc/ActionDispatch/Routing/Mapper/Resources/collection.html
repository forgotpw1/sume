<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#collection</h1>


<p>To add a route to the collection:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">resources :photos do
  collection do
    get 'search'
  end
end</pre>

<p>This will enable Rails to recognize paths such as <tt>/photos/search</tt>
with GET, and route to the search action of <tt>PhotosController</tt>. It
will also create the <tt>search_photos_url</tt> and
<tt>search_photos_path</tt> route helpers.</p>
