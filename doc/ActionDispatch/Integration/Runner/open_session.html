<h1>ActionDispatch::Integration::Runner#open_session</h1>


<p>Open a new session instance. If a block is given, the new session is
yielded to the block before being returned.</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">session = open_session do |sess|
  sess.extend(CustomAssertions)
end</pre>

<p>By default, a single session is automatically created for you, but you can
use this method to open multiple sessions that ought to be tested
simultaneously.</p>
