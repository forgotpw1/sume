<h1>ActionDispatch::Integration::Runner#open_session</h1>

Open a new session instance. If a block is given, the new session is
yielded to the block before being returned.

  session = open_session do |sess|
    sess.extend(CustomAssertions)
  end

By default, a single session is automatically created for you, but you
can use this method to open multiple sessions that ought to be tested
simultaneously.
