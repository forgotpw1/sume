<h1>ActionDispatch::Integration::RequestHelpers#request_via_redirect</h1>

Performs a request using the specified method, following any subsequent
redirect. Note that the redirects are followed until the response is
not a redirect--this means you may run into an infinite loop if your
redirect loops back to itself.
