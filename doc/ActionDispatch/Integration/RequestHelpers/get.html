<h1>ActionDispatch::Integration::RequestHelpers#get</h1>

Performs a GET request with the given parameters.

- +path+: The URI (as a String) on which you want to perform a GET
  request.
- +parameters+: The HTTP parameters that you want to pass. This may

  a Hash, or a String that is appropriately encoded
  (<tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt> or
  <tt>multipart/form-data</tt>).
- +headers+: Additional headers to pass, as a Hash. The headers will be
  merged into the Rack env hash.

This method returns an Response object, which one can use to
inspect the details of the response. Furthermore, if this method was
called from an ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest object, then that
object's <tt>@response</tt> instance variable will point to the same
response object.

You can also perform POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD requests with
+#post+, +#patch+, +#put+, +#delete+, and +#head+.
