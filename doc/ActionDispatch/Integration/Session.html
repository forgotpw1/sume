An instance of this class represents a set of requests and responses
performed sequentially by a test process. Because you can instantiate
multiple sessions and run them side-by-side, you can also mimic (to some
limited extent) multiple simultaneous users interacting with your system.

Typically, you will instantiate a new session using
IntegrationTest#open_session, rather than instantiating
Integration::Session directly.
