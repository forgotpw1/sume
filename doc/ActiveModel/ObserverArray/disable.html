    #    Other models will still notify the AuditTrail observer.

  ORM.observers.disable :observer_1, :observer_2
    # => disables Observer1 and Observer2 for all models.

  ORM.observers.disable :all
    # => disables all observers for all models.

  User.observers.disable :all do
    # all user observers are disabled for
    # just the duration of the block
  end
