<h1>ActiveModel::ObserverArray#enable</h1>

Enables one or more observers. This supports multiple forms:

  ORM.observers.enable :user_observer
    # => enables the UserObserver

  User.observers.enable AuditTrail
    # => enables the AuditTrail observer for User notifications.
    #    Other models will not be affected (i.e. they will not
    #    trigger notifications to AuditTrail if previously disabled)

  ORM.observers.enable :observer_1, :observer_2
    # => enables Observer1 and Observer2 for all models.

  ORM.observers.enable :all
    # => enables all observers for all models.

  User.observers.enable :all do
    # all user observers are enabled for
    # just the duration of the block
  end

Note: all observers are enabled by default. This method is only
useful when you have previously disabled one or more observers.
