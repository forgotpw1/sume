== Active Model Lint Tests

You can test whether an object is compliant with the Active Model API by
including <tt>ActiveModel::Lint::Tests</tt> in your TestCase. It will
include tests that tell you whether your object is fully compliant,
or if not, which aspects of the API are not implemented.

Note an object is not required to implement all APIs in order to work
with Action Pack. This module only intends to provide guidance in case
you want all features out of the box.

These tests do not attempt to determine the semantic correctness of the
returned values. For instance, you could implement valid? to always
return true, and the tests would pass. It is up to you to ensure that
the values are semantically meaningful.

Objects you pass in are expected to return a compliant object from a
call to to_model. It is perfectly fine for to_model to return self.
