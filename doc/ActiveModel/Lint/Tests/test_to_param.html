<h1>ActiveModel::Lint::Tests#test_to_param</h1>

== Responds to <tt>to_param</tt>

Returns a string representing the object's key suitable for use in URLs
or nil if model.persisted? is false.

Implementers can decide to either raise an exception or provide a default
in case the record uses a composite primary key. There are no tests for this
behavior in lint because it doesn't make sense to force any of the possible
implementation strategies on the implementer. However, if the resource is
not persisted?, then to_param should always return nil.
