== Responds to <tt>persisted?</tt>

Returns a boolean that specifies whether the object has been persisted yet.
This is used when calculating the URL for an object. If the object is
not persisted, a form for that object, for instance, will route to the
create action. If it is persisted, a form for the object will routes to
the update action.
