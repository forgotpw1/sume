== Active Model Naming

Creates a +model_name+ method on your object.

To implement, just extend ActiveModel::Naming in your object:

  class BookCover
    extend ActiveModel::Naming
  end

  BookCover.model_name        # => "BookCover"
  BookCover.model_name.human  # => "Book cover"

  BookCover.model_name.i18n_key              # => :book_cover
  BookModule::BookCover.model_name.i18n_key  # => :"book_module/book_cover"

Providing the functionality that ActiveModel::Naming provides in your object
is required to pass the Active Model Lint test. So either extending the provided
method below, or rolling your own is required.
