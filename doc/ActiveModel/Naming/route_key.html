<h1>ActiveModel::Naming.route_key</h1>

Returns string to use while generating route names. It differs for
namespaced models regarding whether it's inside isolated engine.

For isolated engine:
ActiveModel::Naming.route_key(Blog::Post) #=> posts

For shared engine:
ActiveModel::Naming.route_key(Blog::Post) #=> blog_posts

The route key also considers if the noun is uncountable and, in
such cases, automatically appends _index.
