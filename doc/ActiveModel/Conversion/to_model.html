<h1>ActiveModel::Conversion#to_model</h1>

If your object is already designed to implement all of the Active Model
you can use the default <tt>:to_model</tt> implementation, which simply
returns self.

If your model does not act like an Active Model object, then you should
define <tt>:to_model</tt> yourself returning a proxy object that wraps
your object with Active Model compliant methods.
