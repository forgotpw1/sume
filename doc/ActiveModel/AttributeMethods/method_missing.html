<h1>ActiveModel::AttributeMethods#method_missing</h1>

Allows access to the object attributes, which are held in the
<tt>@attributes</tt> hash, as though they were first-class methods. So a
Person class with a name attribute can use Person#name and Person#name=
and never directly use the attributes hash -- except for multiple assigns
with ActiveRecord#attributes=. A Milestone class can also ask
Milestone#completed? to test that the completed attribute is not +nil+
or 0.

It's also possible to instantiate related objects, so a Client class
belonging to the clients table with a +master_id+ foreign key can
instantiate master through Client#master.
