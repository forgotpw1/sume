<h1>ActiveModel::AttributeMethods::ClassMethods#attribute_method_matchers_cache</h1>

The methods +method_missing+ and +respond_to?+ of this module are
invoked often in a typical rails, both of which invoke the method
+match_attribute_method?+. The latter method iterates through an
array doing regular expression matches, which results in a lot of
object creations. Most of the times it returns a +nil+ match. As the
match result is always the same given a +method_name+, this cache is
used to alleviate the GC, which ultimately also speeds up the app
significantly (in our case our test suite finishes 10% faster with
this cache).
