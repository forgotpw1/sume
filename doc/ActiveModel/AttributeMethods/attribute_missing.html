<h1>ActiveModel::AttributeMethods#attribute_missing</h1>

attribute_missing is like method_missing, but for attributes. When method_missing is
called we check to see if there is a matching attribute method. If so, we call
attribute_missing to dispatch the attribute. This method can be overloaded to
customise the behaviour.
