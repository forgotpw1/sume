== Active Model Translation

Provides integration between your object and the Rails internationalization
(i18n) framework.

A minimal implementation could be:

  class TranslatedPerson
    extend ActiveModel::Translation
  end

  TranslatedPerson.human_attribute_name('my_attribute')
  # => "My attribute"

This also provides the required class methods for hooking into the
Rails internationalization API, including being able to define a
class based +i18n_scope+ and +lookup_ancestors+ to find translations in
parent classes.
