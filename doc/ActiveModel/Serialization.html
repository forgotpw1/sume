== Active Model Serialization

Provides a basic serialization to a serializable_hash for your object.

A minimal implementation could be:

  class Person
    include ActiveModel::Serialization

    attr_accessor :name

    def attributes
      => nil
    end
  end

Which would provide you with:

  person = Person.new
  person.serializable_hash   # => &quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil
  person.name = "Bob"
  person.serializable_hash   # => &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Bob&quot;

You need to declare an attributes hash which contains the attributes
you want to serialize. Attributes must be strings, not symbols.
When called, serializable hash will use
instance methods that match the name of the attributes hash's keys.
In order to override this behavior, take a look at the private
method +read_attribute_for_serialization+.

Most of the time though, you will want to include the JSON or XML
serializations. Both of these modules automatically include the
<tt>ActiveModel::Serialization</tt> module, so there is no need to explicitly
include it.

A minimal implementation including XML and JSON would be:

  class Person
    include ActiveModel::Serializers::JSON
    include ActiveModel::Serializers::Xml

    attr_accessor :name

    def attributes
      => nil
    end
  end

Which would provide you with:

  person = Person.new
  person.serializable_hash   # => &quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil
  person.as_json             # => &quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil
  person.to_json             # => "\&quot;name\&quot;:null"
  person.to_xml              # => "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<serial-person...

  person.name = "Bob"
  person.serializable_hash   # => &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Bob&quot;
  person.as_json             # => &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Bob&quot;
  person.to_json             # => "\&quot;name\&quot;:\&quot;Bob\&quot;"
  person.to_xml              # => "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<serial-person...

Valid options are <tt>:only</tt>, <tt>:except</tt>, <tt>:methods</tt> and <tt>:include</tt>.
The following are all valid examples:

  person.serializable_hash(:only => 'name')
  person.serializable_hash(:include => :address)
  person.serializable_hash(:include => { :address => { :only => 'city' }})
