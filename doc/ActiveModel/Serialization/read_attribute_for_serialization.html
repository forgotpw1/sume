<h1>ActiveModel::Serialization#read_attribute_for_serialization</h1>

Hook method defining how an attribute value should be retrieved for
serialization. By default this is assumed to be an instance named after
the attribute. Override this method in subclasses should you need to
retrieve the value for a given attribute differently:

  class MyClass
    include ActiveModel::Validations

    def initialize(data = {})
      @data = data
    end

    def read_attribute_for_serialization(key)
      @data[key]
    end
  end
