<h1>ActiveModel::Validations::ClassMethods#validates!</h1>

This method is used to define validations that cannot be corrected by end
users and are considered exceptional. So each validator defined with bang
or <tt>:strict</tt> option set to <tt>true</tt> will always raise
<tt>ActiveModel::StrictValidationFailed</tt> instead of adding error
when validation fails.
See <tt>validates</tt> for more information about the validation itself.
