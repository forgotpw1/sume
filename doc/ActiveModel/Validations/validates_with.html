<h1>ActiveModel::Validations#validates_with</h1>

Passes the record off to the class or classes specified and allows them
to add errors based on more complex conditions.

  class Person
    include ActiveModel::Validations

    validate :instance_validations

    def instance_validations
      validates_with MyValidator
    end
  end

Please consult the class method documentation for more information on
creating your own validator.

You may also pass it multiple classes, like so:

  class Person
    include ActiveModel::Validations

    validate :instance_validations, :on => :create

    def instance_validations
      validates_with MyValidator, MyOtherValidator
    end
  end

Standard configuration options (:on, :if and :unless), which are
available on the class version of +validates_with+, should instead be
placed on the +validates+ method as these are applied and tested
in the callback.

If you pass any additional configuration options, they will be passed
to the class and available as +options+, please refer to the
class version of this method for more information.
