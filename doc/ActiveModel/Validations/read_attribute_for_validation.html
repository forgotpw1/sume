<h1>ActiveModel::Validations#read_attribute_for_validation</h1>

Hook method defining how an attribute value should be retrieved. By default
this is assumed to be an instance named after the attribute. Override this
method in subclasses should you need to retrieve the value for a given
attribute differently:

  class MyClass
    include ActiveModel::Validations

    def initialize(data = {})
      @data = data
    end

    def read_attribute_for_validation(key)
      @data[key]
    end
  end
