This API is for Rails' internal use and is not currently considered 'public', so
it may change in the future without warning.

It creates configuration attributes that can be inherited from a module down
to a class that includes the module. E.g.

  module MyModel
    extend ActiveModel::Configuration
    config_attribute :awesome
    self.awesome = true
  end

  class Post
    include MyModel
  end

  Post.awesome # => true

  Post.awesome = false
  Post.awesome    # => false
  MyModel.awesome # => true

We assume that the module will have a ClassMethods submodule containing methods
to be transferred to the including class' singleton class.

Config options can also be defined directly on a class:

  class Post
    extend ActiveModel::Configuration
    config_attribute :awesome
  end

So this allows us to define a module that doesn't care about whether it is being
included in a class or a module:

  module Awesomeness
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    included do
      extend ActiveModel::Configuration
      config_attribute :awesome
      self.awesome = true
    end
  end

  class Post
    include Awesomeness
  end

  module AwesomeModel
    include Awesomeness
  end
