== Active Model Observers

Observer classes respond to life cycle callbacks to implement trigger-like
behavior outside the original class. This is a great way to reduce the
clutter that normally comes when the model class is burdened with
functionality that doesn't pertain to the core responsibility of the
class. Example:

  class CommentObserver < ActiveModel::Observer
    def after_save(comment)
      Notifications.comment("admin@do.com", "New comment was posted", comment).deliver
    end
  end

This Observer sends an email when a Comment#save is finished.

  class ContactObserver < ActiveModel::Observer
    def after_create(contact)
      contact.logger.info('New contact added!')
    end

    def after_destroy(contact)
      contact.logger.warn("Contact with an id of #contactcontact.id was destroyed!")
    end
  end

This Observer uses logger to log when specific callbacks are triggered.

== Observing a class that can't be inferred

Observers will by default be mapped to the class with which they share a
name. So CommentObserver will be tied to observing Comment, ProductManagerObserver
to ProductManager, and so on. If you want to name your observer differently than
the class you're interested in observing, you can use the <tt>Observer.observe</tt>
class method which takes either the concrete class (Product) or a symbol for that
class (:product):

  class AuditObserver < ActiveModel::Observer
    observe :account

    def after_update(account)
      AuditTrail.new(account, "UPDATED")
    end
  end

If the audit observer needs to watch more than one kind of object, this can be
specified with multiple arguments:

  class AuditObserver < ActiveModel::Observer
    observe :account, :balance

    def after_update(record)
      AuditTrail.new(record, "UPDATED")
    end
  end

The AuditObserver will now act on both updates to Account and Balance by treating
them both as records.

If you're using an Observer in a Rails application with Active Record, be sure to
read about the necessary configuration in the documentation for
ActiveRecord::Observer.
