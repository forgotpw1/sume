Mass assignment security provides an interface for protecting attributes
from end-user assignment. For more complex permissions, mass assignment security
may be handled outside the model by extending a non-ActiveRecord class,
such as a controller, with this behavior.

For example, a logged in user may need to assign additional attributes depending
on their role:

  class AccountsController < ApplicationController
    include ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity

    attr_accessible :first_name, :last_name
    attr_accessible :first_name, :last_name, :plan_id, :as => :admin

    def update
      ...
      @account.update_attributes(account_params)
      ...
    end

    protected

    def account_params
      role = admin ? :admin : :default
      sanitize_for_mass_assignment(params[:account], role)
    end

  end

= Configuration options

* <tt>mass_assignment_sanitizer</tt> - Defines sanitize method. Possible values are:
  * <tt>:logger</tt> (default) - writes filtered attributes to logger
  * <tt>:strict</tt> - raise <tt>ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity::Error</tt> on any protected attribute update

You can specify your own sanitizer object eg. MySanitizer.new.
See <tt>ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity::LoggerSanitizer</tt> for example implementation.
