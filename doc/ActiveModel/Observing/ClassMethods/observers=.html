<h1>ActiveModel::Observing::ClassMethods#observers=</h1>

== Active Model Observers Activation

Activates the observers assigned. Examples:

  class ORM
    include ActiveModel::Observing
  end

  # Calls PersonObserver.instance
  ORM.observers = :person_observer

  # Calls Cacher.instance and GarbageCollector.instance
  ORM.observers = :cacher, :garbage_collector

  # Same as above, just using explicit class references
  ORM.observers = Cacher, GarbageCollector

Note: Setting this does not instantiate the observers yet.
+instantiate_observers+ is called during startup, and before
each development request.
