== Active Model Attribute Methods

<tt>ActiveModel::AttributeMethods</tt> provides a way to add prefixes and suffixes
to your methods as well as handling the creation of Active Record like class methods
such as +table_name+.

The requirements to implement ActiveModel::AttributeMethods are to:

* <tt>include ActiveModel::AttributeMethods</tt> in your object
* Call each Attribute Method module method you want to add, such as
  attribute_method_suffix or attribute_method_prefix
* Call <tt>define_attribute_methods</tt> after the other methods are
  called.
* Define the various generic +_attribute+ methods that you have declared

A minimal implementation could be:

  class Person
    include ActiveModel::AttributeMethods

    attribute_method_affix  :prefix => 'reset_', :suffix => '_to_default!'
    attribute_method_suffix '_contrived?'
    attribute_method_prefix 'clear_'
    define_attribute_methods 'name'

    attr_accessor :name

    private

    def attribute_contrived?(attr)
      true
    end

    def clear_attribute(attr)
      send("#attr=", nil)
    end

    def reset_attribute_to_default!(attr)
      send("#attr=", "Default Name")
    end
  end

Note that whenever you include ActiveModel::AttributeMethods in your class,
it requires you to implement an <tt>attributes</tt> method which returns a hash
with each attribute name in your model as hash key and the attribute value as
hash value.

Hash keys must be strings.
