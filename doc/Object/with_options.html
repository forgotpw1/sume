<h1>Object#with_options</h1>


<p>An elegant way to factor duplication out of options passed to a series of
method calls. Each method called in the block, with the block variable as
the receiver, will have its options merged with the default
<tt>options</tt> hash provided. Each method called on the block variable
must take an options hash as its final argument.</p>

<p>Without <tt>with_options&gt;</tt>, this code contains duplication:</p>

<pre>class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :customers, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :products,  :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :invoices,  :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :expenses,  :dependent =&gt; :destroy
end</pre>

<p>Using <tt>with_options</tt>, we can remove the duplication:</p>

<pre>class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  with_options :dependent =&gt; :destroy do |assoc|
    assoc.has_many :customers
    assoc.has_many :products
    assoc.has_many :invoices
    assoc.has_many :expenses
  end
end</pre>

<p>It can also be used with an explicit receiver:</p>

<pre>I18n.with_options :locale =&gt; user.locale, :scope =&gt; &quot;newsletter&quot; do |i18n|
  subject i18n.t :subject
  body    i18n.t :body, :user_name =&gt; user.name
end</pre>

<p><tt>with_options</tt> can also be nested since the call is forwarded to its
receiver. Each nesting level will merge inherited defaults in addition to
their own.</p>
