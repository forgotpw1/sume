<h1>Object#try</h1>

Invokes the public method identified by the symbol +method+, passing it any arguments
and/or the block specified, just like the regular Ruby <tt>Object#public_send</tt> does.

*Unlike* that method however, a +NoMethodError+ exception will *not* be raised
and +nil+ will be returned instead, if the receiving object is a +nil+ object or NilClass.

If try is called without a method to call, it will yield any given block with the object.

Please also note that +try+ is defined on +Object+, therefore it won't work with
subclasses of +BasicObject+. For example, using try with +SimpleDelegator+ will
delegate +try+ to target instead of calling it on delegator itself.

==== Examples

Without +try+
  @person && @person.name
or
  @person ? @person.name : nil

With +try+
  @person.try(:name)

+try+ also accepts arguments and/or a block, for the method it is trying
  Person.try(:find, 1)
  @people.try(:collect) {|p| p.name}

Without a method argument try will yield to the block unless the receiver is nil.
  @person.try { |p| "#{p.first_name} #{p.last_name}" }
--
+try+ behaves like +Object#public_send+, unless called on +NilClass+.
