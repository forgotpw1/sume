<h1>Object#acts_like?</h1>

A duck-type assistant method. For example, Active Support extends Date
to define an acts_like_date? method, and extends Time to define
acts_like_time?. As a result, we can do "x.acts_like?(:time)" and
"x.acts_like?(:date)" to do duck-type-safe comparisons, since classes that
we want to act like Time simply need to define an acts_like_time? method.
