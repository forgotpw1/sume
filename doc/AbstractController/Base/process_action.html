<h1>AbstractController::Base#process_action</h1>

Call the action. Override this in a subclass to modify the
behavior around processing an action. This, and not #process,
is the intended way to override action dispatching.

Notice that the first argument is the method to be dispatched
which is *not* necessarily the same as the action name.
