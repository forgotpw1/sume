<h1>AbstractController::Base#process_action</h1>


<p>Call the action. Override this in a subclass to modify the behavior around
processing an action. This, and not #process, is the intended way to
override action dispatching.</p>

<p>Notice that the first argument is the method to be dispatched which is
<b>not</b> necessarily the same as the action name.</p>
