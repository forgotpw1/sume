<h1>AbstractController::Base#available_action?</h1>


<p>Returns true if a method for the action is available and can be dispatched,
false otherwise.</p>

<p>Notice that <tt>action_methods.include?(&quot;foo&quot;)</tt> may return
false and <tt>available_action?(&quot;foo&quot;)</tt> returns true because
available action consider actions that are also available through other
means, for example, implicit render ones.</p>
