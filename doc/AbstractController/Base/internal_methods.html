<h1>AbstractController::Base.internal_methods</h1>


<p>A list of all internal methods for a controller. This finds the first
abstract superclass of a controller, and gets a list of all public instance
methods on that abstract class. Public instance methods of a controller
would normally be considered action methods, so methods declared on
abstract classes are being removed. (ActionController::Metal and
ActionController::Base are defined as abstract)</p>
