<h1>AbstractController::Helpers::ClassMethods#helper</h1>

The +helper+ class method can take a series of helper module names, a block, or both.

==== Parameters
* <tt>*args</tt> - Module, Symbol, String, :all
* <tt>block</tt> - A block defining helper methods

==== Examples
When the argument is a module it will be included directly in the template class.
  helper FooHelper # => includes FooHelper

When the argument is a string or symbol, the method will provide the "_helper" suffix, require the file
and include the module in the template class. The second form illustrates how to include custom helpers
when working with namespaced controllers, or other cases where the file containing the helper definition is not
in one of Rails' standard load paths:
  helper :foo             # => requires 'foo_helper' and includes FooHelper
  helper 'resources/foo'  # => requires 'resources/foo_helper' and includes Resources::FooHelper

Additionally, the +helper+ class method can receive and evaluate a block, making the methods defined available
to the template.

  # One line
  helper { def hello() "Hello, world!" end }

  # Multi-line
  helper do
    def foo(bar)
      "#{bar} is the very best"
    end
  end

Finally, all the above styles can be mixed together, and the +helper+ method can be invoked with a mix of
+symbols+, +strings+, +modules+ and blocks.

  helper(:three, BlindHelper) { def mice() 'mice' end }
