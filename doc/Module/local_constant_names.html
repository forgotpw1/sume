<h1>Module#local_constant_names</h1>

*DEPRECATED*: Use +local_constants+ instead.

Returns the names of the constants defined locally as strings.

  module M
    X = 1
  end
  M.local_constant_names # => ["X"]

This method is useful for forward compatibility, since Ruby 1.8 returns
constant names as strings, whereas 1.9 returns them as symbols.
