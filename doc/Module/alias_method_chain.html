<h1>Module#alias_method_chain</h1>

Encapsulates the common pattern of:

  alias_method :foo_without_feature, :foo
  alias_method :foo, :foo_with_feature

With this, you simply do:

  alias_method_chain :foo, :feature

And both aliases are set up for you.

Query and bang methods (foo?, foo!) keep the same punctuation:

  alias_method_chain :foo?, :feature

is equivalent to

  alias_method :foo_without_feature?, :foo?
  alias_method :foo?, :foo_with_feature?

so you can safely chain foo, foo?, and foo! with the same feature.
